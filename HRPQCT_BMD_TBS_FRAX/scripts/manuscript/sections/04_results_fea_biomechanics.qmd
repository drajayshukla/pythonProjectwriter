**General Osteopenia ($n=91$):**
Radius **Failure Load** was $14.3\%$ lower in fracturers ($p = 0.03$), driven by the loss of trabecular connectivity.

**Diabetic Osteopenia ($n=66$):**
Tibia **Failure Load** was $16.8\%$ lower in fracturers ($p = 0.01$). Critically, in this group, failure load was strongly correlated with **Cortical Porosity** ($r = -0.48$, $p < 0.01$), confirming that porosity acts as the primary stress riser in diabetic bone.

**Running Title:** High Thyroid SUV in Hypothyroidism

**Covering Letter:**
Dear Editor,

We are submitting this Letter to the Editor describing a diagnostic pitfall we recently encountered in a post-radiation patient.

The patient presented with a thyroid SUVmax of 14.0, a value that typically triggers concern for primary thyroid lymphoma or anaplastic carcinoma. However, a detailed review of her history revealed that she had been inappropriately treated with antithyroid drugs (Propylthiouracil) for radiation-induced thyroiditis, leading to profound TSH elevation (> 100 uIU/mL).

We believe this case serves as an important reminder that physiological TSH stimulation alone can produce FDG avidity indistinguishable from high-grade malignancy, provided the ultrasound is structurally benign.

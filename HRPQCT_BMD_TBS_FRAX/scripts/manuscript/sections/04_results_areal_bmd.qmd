## Areal Bone Mineral Density (aBMD)

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was performed in all 215 subjects. In the total cohort, mean $T$-scores at the lumbar spine (L1-L4) and femoral neck were within the osteopenic range for both the fracture and control groups, confirming the "grey zone" status of the study population (Figure 2).

### Osteopenic Sub-cohort ($n=91$)
In the primary osteopenic sub-cohort, densitometry failed to discriminate between fracture and non-fracture status.
* **Lumbar Spine:** $aBMD$ was similar between Fx ($n=47$) and Co ($n=44$) groups ($0.86 \pm 0.09$ vs $0.88 \pm 0.08$ g/cm²; $-2.3\%$, $p = 0.110$).
* **Femoral Neck:** $aBMD$ was virtually identical ($p = 0.713$).

### Diabetic Sub-cohorts
Notably, in the **Diabetic Osteopenia ($n=66$)** subgroup, $aBMD$ values were paradoxically preserved in the fracture group ($+1.4\%$ at femoral neck, $p=0.74$) compared to controls. This "Diabetic Paradox" confirms that $aBMD$ is a poor surrogate for skeletal strength in T2DM.

# Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using Python (v3.11). Data distribution was evaluated using Shapiro-Wilk tests and Q-Q plots. Continuous variables are presented as mean $\pm$ SD.

## Group Comparisons
Differences were evaluated using independent Student’s $t$-tests or Mann-Whitney $U$-tests. To quantify the clinical magnitude of structural deficits beyond simple $p$-values, Cohen’s $d$ was calculated ($d > 0.8$ considered a large effect).

## Discriminative Performance
The primary outcome was the Area Under the Curve (AUC) from Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. We compared the AUC of the Structural Model (HR-pQCT) against the Clinical Model (DXA + TBS) specifically within the $n=91$ osteopenic sub-cohort.

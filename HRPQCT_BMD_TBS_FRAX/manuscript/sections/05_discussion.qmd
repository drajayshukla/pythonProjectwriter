# Discussion

In this cross-sectional study of postmenopausal women, we demonstrate that skeletal fragility in the "Osteopenic Grey Zone" ($T$-score -1.0 to -2.5) is driven by profound microarchitectural and biomechanical deficits that remain largely invisible to standard areal densitometry. Our findings resolve the "prevention paradox" by identifying **Trabecular Disconnection** as the primary failure mode in general osteopenia. Furthermore, our data provides a nuanced update to the diabetic bone phenotype, suggesting that trabecular decay precedes cortical defects in the early stages of the disease, challenging the prevailing "Cortical Switch" dogma in this specific sub-population.

## The Failure of DXA and the "Grey Zone" Paradox

The clinical reliance on $aBMD$ $T$-scores often creates a false sense of security in patients within the moderate-risk range. Our results show that in the osteopenic sub-cohort ($n=91$), the combined clinical model (DXA + FRAX + TBS) yielded an AUC of only 0.60, effectively failing to discriminate between those with and without fractures. This aligns with previous findings that $aBMD$ lacks the sensitivity to capture structural decay [@eBoneMicroarchitectureAssessed2017; @meilinghuangPerformanceHRpQCTDXA2021].

In contrast, the structural model provided a large effect size (Cohen's $d = 0.83$), underscoring that the "hidden" fragility in osteopenia is not a lack of mass, but a catastrophic loss of connectivity. While some studies suggest preserved trabecular bone in T2DM [@jessicafstarrRobustTrabecularMicrostructure2018], our osteopenic cohort reveals this is not protective against fracture. While TBS is often used as a proxy for microarchitecture, our data suggests that in the moderate-risk range, it lacks the resolution of HR-pQCT to detect the early stages of trabecular thinning and disconnection, consistent with recent reviews [@j.i.martinez-montoroEvaluationQualityBone2022; @s.ferrariBoneMicrostructureTBS2025].

## Trabecular Disconnection: The Mechanism of General Fragility

A primary finding of this study is the significant reduction in $Tb.N$ (-11.6%) and Total $vBMD$ (-13.4%) in fractured osteopenic women compared to age-matched controls. From a biological first-principle perspective, the loss of trabecular number is far more detrimental to biomechanical competence than simple trabecular thinning. As trabeculae are lost, the remaining structure loses its lateral "bracing," leading to a non-linear decrease in stiffness and Failure Load.

Our identified $Tb.N$ threshold aligns with the **OFELY study** by Sornay-Rendu et al., which posited that trabecular deterioration is the hallmark of non-vertebral fracture risk [@eBoneMicroarchitectureAssessed2017]. In the "Grey Zone," this disconnection represents the tipping point where a moderate reduction in mass leads to a disproportionate increase in fragility.

## The Diabetic "Non-Switch": A Temporal Hypothesis

Our subgroup analysis of T2DM patients ($n=66$ in the grey zone) provides a striking insight that refines the current understanding of diabetic bone disease. 

**Challenging the Cortical Primacy:** Seminal work by Patsch et al. [@j.patschIncreasedCorticalPorosity2013] and others has established **Cortical Porosity** as the signature defect in diabetic osteoporosis [@j.patschIncreasedCorticalPorosity2013; @e.samelsonDiabetesDeficitsCortical2018; @v.shanbhogueCompromisedCorticalBone2015]. However, these studies predominantly focused on cohorts with established fragility or broader BMD ranges. In our specific **osteopenic** cohort, we found that cortical porosity was **not** the primary discriminator ($p=0.26$). Instead, **Trabecular Disconnection** ($d=0.99$) remained the dominant driver of fragility.

**The "Canary in the Coal Mine":** This apparent contradiction suggests a **Temporal Hierarchy of Diabetic Bone Disease**:
1.  **Phase 1 (Early/Osteopenic):** Metabolic dysfunction and AGE accumulation initially compromise the trabecular scaffold, accelerating age-related disconnection. This is consistent with findings by Haraguchi et al. [@a.haraguchiEffectLuseogliflozinBone2019], who noted deterioration in bone quality independent of BMD [@a.haraguchiEffectLuseogliflozinBone2019].
2.  **Phase 2 (Late/Osteoporotic):** As the disease progresses, cortical vascularity increases and pore expansion occurs, leading to the "Swiss-Cheese" cortex seen in more advanced cohorts [@elainew.yuDefectsCorticalMicroarchitecture2015]. [@j.patschIncreasedCorticalPorosity2013; @elainew.yuDefectsCorticalMicroarchitecture2015].

This distinction is clinically vital. It implies that for osteopenic diabetics, clinicians should not wait for cortical defects to appear. Instead, early intervention must focus on preserving the trabecular microarchitecture before it disconnects irreversibly. Our data supports the notion that $Tb.N$ acts as the "canary in the coal mine" for early diabetic fragility.

## Strengths and Limitations

The strengths of this study include the strict "Entry Ticket" criteria ensuring high-quality HR-pQCT data and the rigorous hierarchical analysis validated in a large cohort ($N=215$). The use of $\mu$FEA provides a functional assessment of bone strength beyond simple morphology.

Limitations include the cross-sectional design, which prevents establishing causality. Additionally, our T2DM cohort was relatively well-controlled (mean HbA1c 7.2%), which may explain the lack of severe cortical porosity compared to studies with more uncontrolled diabetic populations. Future longitudinal studies are needed to track the progression from trabecular to cortical failure.

## Conclusion

Skeletal fragility in the osteopenic grey zone is driven by **Trabecular Disconnection**, a structural failure invisible to DXA. In early-stage (osteopenic) diabetes, this trabecular failure remains the primary culprit, challenging the notion of an immediate "cortical switch." These findings advocate for the integration of HR-pQCT as a stratification tool to identify patients at imminent risk who fall below traditional treatment thresholds.

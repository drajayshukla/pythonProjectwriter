**Table 5: The 'Clinical Silence' in High-Risk Subgroups (P-values for Traditional Risk Factors)**

| Cohort | Steroid Use | Current Smoking | Family Hx (Mother) | Thyroid Disease |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Total Cohort (N=269) | 0.837 | - | 0.323 | **0.003** |
| Osteopenic Cohort (N=111) | 1.000 | - | 0.397 | **<0.001** |
| Diabetic Cohort (N=123) | 1.000 | - | 0.982 | 0.473 |
| Diabetic Osteopenic (N=52) | 1.000 | - | 0.864 | 0.227 |

*Note: Values represent Chi-square P-values. Bold indicates statistical significance (p<0.05). Note the loss of predictive power (loss of bolding) in the Osteopenic and Diabetic subgroups for standard factors like Steroids and Family History.*

  abstract = {Background Older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have an increased risk of bone fracture independent of their bone mineral density (BMD), which is explained mainly by the deteriorated bone quality in T2DM compared to that in non-diabetic adults. Sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitors have been studied in several trials in T2DM, and the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study showed an increased fracture risk related to treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin, although no evidence of increased fracture risk with treatment with other SGLT2 inhibitors has been reported. The mechanism of the difference in the fracture risk between the SGLT2 inhibitors is unknown, but the differences among the SGLT2 inhibitors in the selectivity of SGLT2 against SGLT1 may affect bone metabolism, since among the SGLT2 inhibitors the selectivity of canagliflozin is lowest. We will investigate whether the SGLT2 inhibitor luseogliflozin, which has the higher SGLT2 selectivity, affects bone metabolism by using high-resolution, peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) which provides direct in vivo morphometric information about the bone microarchitecture. Methods/design This is a single-center, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, parallel pilot trial. Eligible participants are older (age\,{$\geq$}\,60\,years) individuals with T2DM with HbA1c levels at 7.0--8.9}

  abstract = {Hemodialysis (HD) patients face increased fracture risk, which is further associated with elevated risk of hospitalization and mortality. High-resolution peripheral computed tomography (HR-pQCT) has advanced our understanding of bone disease in chronic kidney disease by characterizing distinct changes in both the cortical and trabecular compartments. Increased cortical porosity (Ct.Po) has been shown to be associated with fracture in patients with osteopenia or in postmenopausal diabetic women. We tested whether the degree of Ct.Po identifies hemodialysis patients with prevalent fragility fractures in comparison to bone mineral density (BMD) assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). We performed a post-hoc analysis of a cross-sectional study in 76 prevalent hemodialysis patients. Markers of mineral metabolism, coronary calcification score, DXA-, and HR-pQCT-data were analyzed, and Ct.Po determined at radius and tibia. Ct.Po was significantly higher in patients with fracture but association was lost after adjusting for age and gender (tibia p = 0.228, radius p = 0.5). Instead, femoral (F) BMD neck area (p = 0.03), F T-score neck area (p = 0.03), radius (R) BMD (p = 0.03), R T-score (p = 0.03), and cortical HR-pQCT indices such as cortical area (Ct.Ar) (tibia: p = 0.01; radius: p = 0.02) and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) (tibia: p = 0.03; radius: p = 0.02) correctly classified patients with fragility fractures. Area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for Ct.Po (tibia AUC: 0.711; p = 0.01; radius AUC: 0.666; p = 0.04), Ct.Ar (tibia AUC: 0.832; p{\textexclamdown}0.001; radius AUC: 0.796; p{\textexclamdown}0.001), and F neck BMD (AUC: 0.758; p = 0.002) did not differ significantly among each other.

In this study, participants were members of the Framingham Offspring Cohort (769 women, 595 men; mean age 70\,{\textpm}\,8 years), who underwent high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) scanning at the tibia and radius in 2012 to 2016. Weight measurements taken every 4 to 6 years were used to assess recent weight change over 6 years and long-term change over 40 years. General linear models, adjusting for age, sex, height, smoking, and diabetes, were used to evaluate the association between HR-pQCT indices and relative long-term and recent weight change. We found that long-term and recent weight loss were associated with lower cortical density and thickness, higher cortical porosity, and lower trabecular density and number. Associations were stronger for the tibia than radius. Failure load was lower in those individuals with long-term but not short-term weight loss. Deterioration in both cortical and trabecular indices, especially at the weight-bearing skeleton, characterizes bone fragility associated with long-term and recent weight loss in older adults. {\copyright} 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.}

  abstract = {Diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is associated with increased fracture risk that cannot be fully explained by traditional bone mineral density (BMD) measurements. Emerging evidence suggests that diabetes-induced alterations in bone microarchitecture, remodeling, and mechanoregulation contribute to skeletal fragility. However, the specific structural and functional changes in bone differ between T1DM and T2DM, and the mechanisms underlying these differences remain incompletely understood.Innovation in medical imaging and increasingly accessible computational power have made it possible to monitor changes in bone microarchitecture and measure the mechanical properties of bone via image-based finite element analysis. Moreover, longitudinal clinical studies have also shown that the combined use of high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) and micro-finite element analysis can be used to measure load-driven bone remodelling in vivo.This talk will present findings from a meta-analysis of high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) studies assessing diabetes-related differences in bone structure and a longitudinal cohort study, conducted with partners from the FIDELIO -- Bone Health in Diabetes Innovative Training Network, examining bone remodeling and mechanoregulation in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).The meta-analysis synthesized data from 16 studies, encompassing 743 individuals with diabetes and 3,472 controls, to characterize the impact of T1DM and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on bone microarchitecture. Results revealed that T1DM is predominantly associated with adverse trabecular characteristics, whereas T2DM is linked to cortical deficits, with more pronounced deterioration at the radius than at the weight-bearing tibia. These findings suggest that mechanical loading may mitigate some diabetes-associated skeletal changes, emphasizing the role of mechanoregulation in bone fragility.Complementing these insights, a four-year longitudinal cohort study investigated bone remodeling dynamics and responsiveness to mechanical stimuli in individuals with T1DM and diabetic neuropathy. By integrating HR-pQCT imaging with micro-finite element analysis, the study found that T1DM is characterized by lower trabecular bone formation (47}

However, traditional techniques for the evaluation of bone fragility, such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), do not perform well in this population. Moreover, the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) usually underestimates fracture risk in T2DM. Importantly, novel technologies for the assessment of one microarchitecture in patients with T2DM, such as the trabecular bone score (TBS), high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT), and microindentation, are emerging. Furthermore, different serum and urine bone biomarkers may also be useful for the evaluation of bone quality in T2DM. Hence, in this article, we summarize the limitations of conventional tools for the evaluation of bone fragility and review the current evidence on novel approaches for the assessment of quality and bone microstructure alterations in patients with T2DM.}

  abstract = {Type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients have an increased fracture risk, which may be partly explained by compromised bone microarchitecture within the cortical bone compartment. Data on trabecular bone parameters in T2D are contradictory. By high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT), trabecular microarchitecture is preserved, yet larger trabecular holes are detected in T2D by MRI and DXA-based trabecular bone scores are abnormal. To determine if there are differences in trabecular microstructure, connectivity, and alignment in postmenopausal women with T2D as compared with controls, we performed an individual trabecula segmentation (ITS) analysis on HR-pQCT scans of the distal radius and tibia in 92 women with (n\,=\,42) and without (n\,=\,50) T2D. Unadjusted analyses showed that T2D subjects had greater total trabecular bone volume, trabecular plate volume fraction, plate number density, plate junction density, and axial alignment at the radius and tibia, and increased plate tissue fraction, but decreased rod tissue fraction and rod length at the radius (p\,{\textexclamdown}\,0.05 for all). After adjustments for clinical covariates, plate number density and plate junction density remained higher at the radius and tibia, whereas total trabecular bone volume was increased and trabecular rod length was decreased at the radius. These differences remained significant after adjustment for hip BMD and trabecular volumetric bone density. Notably, the increased plate-like ITS qualities were seen in those with T2D duration of {\textexclamdown}10 years, whereas ITS parameters in subjects with T2D duration {$\geq$}10 years did not differ from those of control subjects. In conclusion, postmenopausal women with early T2D had a greater plate-like and less rod-like trabecular network. This early advantage in trabecular plate quality does not explain the well-established increased fracture risk in these patients and does not persist in the later stage of T2D. {\copyright} 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.}

OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between T2DM and HR-pQCT parameters in older men. METHODS HR-pQCT scans were acquired on 1794 participants in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study. T2DM was ascertained by self-report or medication use. Linear regression models, adjusted for age, race, BMI, limb length, clinic site, and oral corticosteroid use, were used to compare HR-pQCT parameters by diabetes status. RESULTS Among 1777 men, 290 had T2DM (mean age 84.4 years). T2DM men had smaller total cross-sectional area (Tt.AR) at the distal tibia (p=0.028) and diaphyseal tibia (p=0.025), and smaller cortical area at the distal (p= 0.009) and diaphyseal tibia (p= 0.023). Trabecular indices and cortical porosity were similar between T2DM and non-T2DM. Among men with T2DM, in a model including HbA1c, diabetes duration, and insulin use, diabetes duration {$\geq$} 10 years, compared with {\textexclamdown}10 years, was significantly associated with higher cortical porosity but with higher trabecular thickness at the distal radius. Insulin use was significantly associated with lower cortical area and thickness at the distal radius and diaphyseal tibia and lower failure load at all three scan sites. Lower cortical area, cortical thickness, total BMD, cortical BMD, and failure load of the distal sites were associated with increased risk of incident non-vertebral fracture in T2DM. CONCLUSIONS Older men with T2DM have smaller bone size compared to non-T2DM, which may contribute to diabetic skeletal fragility. Longer diabetes duration was associated with higher cortical porosity and insulin use with cortical bone deficits and lower failure load.}

  abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is defined by elevated blood glucose levels caused by changes in glucose metabolism and, according to its pathogenesis, is classified into type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 (T2DM) diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is associated with multiple degenerative processes, including structural alterations of the bone and increased fracture risk. High-resolution peripheral computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a clinically applicable, volumetric imaging technique that unveils bone microarchitecture in vivo. Numerous studies have used HR-pQCT to assess volumetric bone mineral density and microarchitecture in patients with diabetes, including characteristics of trabecular (e.g. number, thickness and separation) and cortical bone (e.g. thickness and porosity). However, study results are heterogeneous given different imaging regions and diverse patient cohorts. This meta-analysis assessed T1DM- and T2DM-associated characteristics of bone microarchitecture measured in human populations in vivo reported in PubMed- and Embase-listed publications from inception (2005) to November 2021. The final dataset contained twelve studies with 516 participants with T2DM and 3067 controls and four studies with 227 participants with T1DM and 405 controls. While T1DM was associated with adverse trabecular characteristics, T2DM was primarily associated with adverse cortical characteristics. These adverse effects were more severe at the radius than the load-bearing tibia, indicating increased mechanical loading may compensate for deleterious bone microarchitecture changes and supporting mechanoregulation of bone fragility in diabetes mellitus. Our meta-analysis revealed distinct predilection sites of bone structure aberrations in T1DM and T2DM, which provide a foundation for the development of animal models of skeletal fragility in diabetes and may explain the uncertainty of predicting bone fragility in diabetic patients using current clinical algorithms.}

These findings suggested that HR-pQCT could provide additional information on bone quality of the patients with asymptomatic VF. Introduction Although there were several studies using HR-pQCT to investigate asymptomatic VF, it remains uncertain if HR-pQCT parameters can discriminate asymptomatic VF patients, especially in Chinese population. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether bone quality measured by HR-pQCT could discriminate asymptomatic VF independent of hip areal bone mineral density (aBMD) measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and fracture risks evaluated using built-in Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX BMD ). Methods This is a nested case--control study. One hundred seventy-five ambulatory Chinese postmenopausal women aged 60--79 years were retrieved from Normative Reference Standards (NRS) cohort in Hong Kong. DXA was used to identify VF from lateral spine images (VFA) using Genant's semi-quantitative method. Major osteoporotic fracture risk was calculated using FRAX tool. HR-pQCT was used to assess vBMD, microarchitecture, and estimated strength at both distal radius and tibia.

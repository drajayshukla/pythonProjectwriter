# Case Report

A 51-year-old female presented to the Endocrine clinic in February 2026 with fatigue and weight gain. She had a known history of **Carcinoma of the Left Buccal Mucosa**, managed with composite resection (Nov 2024) followed by 30 cycles of radiotherapy (completed Feb 08, 2025).

**Drug History:**
Following radiotherapy, she was prescribed **Propylthiouracil (PTU) 100 mg BD** for 6 months by an outside physician for thyrotoxicosis.
* **Initial Reports (Post-RT):** $TSH < 0.001 \ \mu IU/mL$, Total $T4 \ 24 \ mcg/dL$, Total $T3 \ 256 \ ng/dL$.
* **Current Analysis:** Retrospective calculation of the **T3/T4 ratio** (ng/mcg) yielded a value of **10.6**, which typically indicates destructive thyroiditis rather than Graves' disease ($>20$). PTU was stopped in May 2025.

**Biochemical Evaluation (Feb 2026):**
* **TSH:** $> 100 \ \mu IU/mL$ (Ref: 0.27–4.2)
* **Free T4:** $0.97 \ ng/dL$ (Ref: 0.93–1.7)
* **Free T3:** $0.2 \ pg/mL$ (Ref: 2.0–4.4)
* **TSH Receptor Antibody (TRAb):** **Negative** (Ruling out Graves' disease).

**Imaging Findings (PET/CT - 30.01.2026):**
An 18F-FDG PET/CT was performed for oncological surveillance.
* **Head & Neck:** Post-surgical changes with diffuse mucosal FDG avidity ($SUV_{max}$ 6.6) in the flap region.
* **Thyroid:** **Intense, diffuse FDG avidity** was noted in both thyroid lobes with an **$SUV_{max}$ of 14.0** (right lobe).
* **Structural:** The CT component showed a morphologically normal thyroid gland.

**Ultrasound Neck:**
Despite the history of radiation, the gland showed **preserved volume and absence of focal nodularity** on high-resolution imaging, ruling out a discrete mass or lymphoma.

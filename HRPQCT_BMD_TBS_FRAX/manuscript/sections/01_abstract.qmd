# Abstract

**Background:** Skeletal management is currently limited by the "prevention paradox," wherein the majority of fragility fractures occur in postmenopausal women with $T$-scores in the osteopenic range ($-2.5 < T < -1.0$). Standard assessment via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) lacks the spatial resolution to capture the 3D microarchitectural determinants of bone strength. We utilized High-Resolution Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR-pQCT) and micro-Finite Element Analysis ($\mu$FEA) to identify the structural drivers of fragility within this diagnostic "grey zone."

**Methods:** This cross-sectional study evaluated 215 postmenopausal women (Total Cohort: $N=215$; 118 fractures, 97 controls). The primary analysis focused on the "Grey Zone" sub-cohort ($n=91$; 47 fractures, 44 controls) with osteopenia. Secondary objectives included validation in the total cohort and phenotyping the impact of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM; $n=140$ total, $n=66$ osteopenic). Assessments included DXA (Lumbar/Hip), Trabecular Bone Score (TBS), and HR-pQCT of the distal radius and tibia.

**Results:** In the primary osteopenic sub-cohort ($n=91$), areal BMD ($aBMD$) and clinical models (DXA + TBS + FRAX) failed to discriminate fracture status (AUC = 0.60; $p > 0.05$). Conversely, HR-pQCT revealed a profound structural triad of densitometric loss (Total $vBMD$: $d = 0.72$), microstructural decay (Trabecular Number [$Tb.N$]: $d = 0.83$), and biomechanical compromise (Failure Load [$F.Load$]: -14.3%; $p = 0.03$). The structural model significantly outperformed the clinical model (AUC 0.76 vs. 0.60; $p < 0.05$). These findings were validated in the Total Cohort ($N=215$), where HR-pQCT parameters maintained superior effect sizes over $aBMD$ ($d = 0.85$ vs. 0.42). 

**Crucially, phenotyping of the T2DM osteopenic subgroup ($n=66$) revealed an unexpected finding:** In this **osteopenic** cohort, diabetic fragility was distinguished by preserved cortical porosity ($p=0.26$) but **accelerated trabecular disconnection** ($d=0.99$), contrasting with the cortical phenotype typically reported in osteoporotic T2DM. This contradicts the "Cortical Switch" hypothesis often cited in advanced osteoporosis, suggesting that in the earlier osteopenic phase, diabetes primarily accelerates trabecular decay.

**Conclusion:** Standard densitometry fails to capture the "hidden fragility" inherent in the osteopenic population. This study identifies **Trabecular Disconnection** as the universal driver of fragility in the grey zone, regardless of diabetic status. Validating these structural drivers suggests that HR-pQCT is an essential stratification tool for patients who fall below traditional DXA-based intervention thresholds.

# Introduction

Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration, resulting in a heightened risk of fragility fractures. The operational definition, established by the World Health Organization (WHO), relies on an areal Bone Mineral Density ($aBMD$) $T$-score $\le -2.5$ assessed by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). While this threshold is highly specific for identifying individuals at the highest risk, it lacks sufficient sensitivity. Epidemiological data, including the National Osteoporosis Risk Assessment (NORA) study, indicate that the majority of fragility fractures actually occur in women with $T$-scores in the osteopenic range (between -1.0 and -2.5)—a clinical phenomenon termed the "prevention paradox" [@eBoneMicroarchitectureAssessed2017].

This diagnostic "grey zone" represents a critical clinical challenge: these patients often fail to meet traditional intervention thresholds and may be excluded from potent anabolic therapies despite demonstrated skeletal fragility. The failure of DXA to accurately stratify risk within this cohort stems from its inherent two-dimensional nature, which cannot resolve the complex three-dimensional (3D) microarchitectural determinants of bone strength. DXA cannot distinguish between cortical and trabecular compartments, nor can it quantify vital parameters like trabecular connectivity or cortical porosity ($Ct.Po$).

High-Resolution Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR-pQCT) has revolutionized bone assessment, acting as a "virtual bone biopsy" to quantify volumetric BMD ($vBMD$) and microarchitecture in vivo [@t.zhuValueMeasuringBone2016]. Pivotal studies have shown that cortical porosity and trabecular density are independent predictors of fracture risk [@eBoneMicroarchitectureAssessed2017; @a.r.bugbirdExternalValidationNovel2025]. However, the specific biomechanical drivers of fracture within the "non-osteoporotic" (osteopenic) subgroup remain under-characterized. Furthermore, in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)—where fracture burden is paradoxically high despite "normal" $aBMD$ [@maAssessmentFractureRisk2019; @aimeed.shuBoneStructureTurnover2012].—the specific structural degradation pathways in the early (osteopenic) stages remain debated.

**Objectives:**
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of HR-pQCT and micro-Finite Element Analysis ($\mu$FEA) in discriminating fracture status within the specific osteopenic subgroup ($n=91$), compared to standard clinical models. Secondary objectives included validation in the total cohort and specific phenotyping of the T2DM impact on bone quality.

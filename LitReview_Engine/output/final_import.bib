 abstract = {Abstract No data exist comparing racial differences in bone microstructure or mechanical competence using HR-pQCT and micro-finite element analysis (μFEA) in elderly Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black (NHB), and non-Hispanic White (NHW) men. These modalities were utilized to investigate skeletal health in 255 elderly men (age ≥ 65) from a population-based study in New York City: 40.0% Caribbean Hispanic (CH), 35.3% NHW, and 24.7% NHB. Covariate-adjusted (age, BMI, calcium consumption, smoking, diabetes, liver disease, and HIV) results are shown. We also explored the effect of socioeconomic (SE) factors. At the distal tibia, CH men had lower trabecular indices with 9% lower stiffness and failure load (both p < .05) compared to NHW. CH men had smaller cortical area (Ct.Ar) and lower thickness (Ct.Th) compared to NHB, with 11% (p < .05) lower stiffness and failure load. After adjusting for SE, differences in stiffness and failure load between CH and NHW were no longer significant. Comparing NHB to NHW men at the tibia, NHB had lower trabecular indices but greater Ct.Ar, Ct. volumetric bone density (Ct.vBMD) and Ct.Th, with no differences in stiffness and failure load. At the diaphyseal tibia, Ct.Ar and Ct.Th were lower in CH compared to both NHW and NHB men, with 11% and 17% lower stiffness and failure load compared to NHW and NHB (all p < .05). Radial μFEA indices were not different. In conclusion, CH elderly men have lower mechanical competence at the tibia compared to NHW and NHB men, which could result in a greater risk of incident fracture in CH men. Some differences between CH and NHW may be related to modifiable SE factors. Studies assessing HR-pQCT’s ability to predict incident fracture and how SE factors affect fracture risk are needed in men of races and ethnicities historically underrepresented in skeletal research.},

 abstract = {Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is associated with increased risk of fractures, worsened by presence of microvascular complications. This study’s objective is to determine the impact of progressive decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on bone biomarkers and bone microarchitecture in youth with T1D. Slopes of eGFR were calculated using measures obtained at four timepoints from adolescence to young adulthood. Participants were identified as eGFR decliners if eGFR decreased ≥ 3ml/min/1.73m2/year. Bone health was assessed in young adulthood by high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT Xtreme CTII) and bone biomarkers; osteocalcin, procollagen 1 intact n-terminal pro-peptide (P1NP), c-terminal telopeptide (CTX), and bone specific alkaline phosphatase. The relationship between diabetes duration, glycated hemoglobin, body mass index (BMI) and vitamin D level on bone biomarkers and microarchitecture was evaluated. Linear regression analysis was used for the statistical analysis in this study. Ninety-nine study participants were studied with longitudinal evaluation of eGFR over 7.4 ± 1.0 years with mean age of 14.7 ± 1.7 years at baseline. Cross sectional evaluation of bone was performed at 21.3 ± 2.1 years. 44% participants had eGFR decline and showed 5% higher cortical porosity diameter than non-decliners (p = 0.035). Greater diabetes duration was associated with higher trabecular separation (p = 0.004) and lower trabecular number (p = 0.01). Higher level of 25 hydroxy-vitamin D was associated with lower trabecular separation (p = 0.01). Elevated glycated hemoglobin (p = 0.0008) and BMI (p = 0.009), were associated with lower markers of bone formation. Mild increase in cortical porosity diameter was found in youth with T1D and eGFR decline, however, overall measures of bone microarchitecture on HR-pQCT were similar between both groups and there were no statistically significant changes in bone biomarkers. Hence, skeletal impairments were limited in youth with different eGFR trajectories near peak bone mass. Longitudinal HR-pQCT studies are needed to further understand the impact of eGFR decline on bone microarchitecture. Optimal glycemic control, normal BMI and vitamin D status were supported by this study as important markers for good bone health.},

 abstract = {Hemodialysis (HD) patients face increased fracture risk, which is further associated with elevated risk of hospitalization and mortality. High-resolution peripheral computed tomography (HR-pQCT) has advanced our understanding of bone disease in chronic kidney disease by characterizing distinct changes in both the cortical and trabecular compartments. Increased cortical porosity (Ct.Po) has been shown to be associated with fracture in patients with osteopenia or in postmenopausal diabetic women. We tested whether the degree of Ct.Po identifies hemodialysis patients with prevalent fragility fractures in comparison to bone mineral density (BMD) assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). We performed a post-hoc analysis of a cross-sectional study in 76 prevalent hemodialysis patients. Markers of mineral metabolism, coronary calcification score, DXA-, and HR-pQCT-data were analyzed, and Ct.Po determined at radius and tibia. Ct.Po was significantly higher in patients with fracture but association was lost after adjusting for age and gender (tibia p = 0.228, radius p = 0.5). Instead, femoral (F) BMD neck area (p = 0.03), F T-score neck area (p = 0.03), radius (R) BMD (p = 0.03), R T-score (p = 0.03), and cortical HR-pQCT indices such as cortical area (Ct.Ar) (tibia: p = 0.01; radius: p = 0.02) and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) (tibia: p = 0.03; radius: p = 0.02) correctly classified patients with fragility fractures. Area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for Ct.Po (tibia AUC: 0.711; p = 0.01; radius AUC: 0.666; p = 0.04), Ct.Ar (tibia AUC: 0.832; p<0.001; radius AUC: 0.796; p<0.001), and F neck BMD (AUC: 0.758; p = 0.002) did not differ significantly among each other. In conclusion, measuring Ct.Po is not superior to BMD determined by DXA for identification of HD patients with fragility fracture.},

 abstract = {Introduction
 Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and osteoporotic fracture are commoner in older patients (pts). Steroids and chemotherapy are recognised as a risk factor (RF) for fragility-related fracture and its associated morbidity. A small randomised trial (RCT) (Westin 2013) showed bisphosphonates stabilize bone mineral density (including all ages / histologies) in NHL pts. Despite this, there is a lack of data defining the specific incidence and fracture risk in older DLBCL pts post R-CHOP. We aimed to better define this risk in this specific cohort.
 Methods
 Data on consecutive DLBCL pts ≥70 years (y) treated with R-CHOP were retrospectively collected across 7 UK centres (2009-2019). Follow up was censored in 07/2019. All pts had untreated, de novo DLBCL or untreated transformed (to DLBCL) indolent B cell NHL. PTLD, HIV and pre-treated NHL pts were excluded. All pts received 1-9 cycles of full or attenuated R-CHOP with curative intent. Pts were excluded if they had progressive disease (PD) or died < 6 months (m) of cycle 1 R-CHOP (RCHOP1). A detailed anonymised database included ECOG performance status (PS), body mass index (BMI), history of osteoporosis / osteopenia, documented steroid pre-phase, vitamin D supplementation, calcium and alkaline phosphatase levels, and sites of bone DLBCL involvement. Fractures at diagnosis (DLBCL-related/unrelated) and pre diagnosis were collected. Fractures (including bone site) occurring during 18m from RCHOP1 were identified from radiology records. Pts were followed for a minimum of 6m and censored at 18m from RCHOP1, or at their last follow up if < 18m or at PD or death if between 6-18m.
 Baseline pt characteristics were descriptive. Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan Meier methods and Cox regression with comparisons between categories using the log-rank test. Time to event analyses were measured from RCHOP1 until fracture event. Primary end point was 18m cumulative fracture incidence censoring pts at death or relapse. Univariable and multivariable analyses (UVA; MVA) of potential influencing RFs for fracture was assessed by Cox regression (Final stepwise model; p=0.1 for inclusion).
 Results
 Of 589 pts identified, 92 pts had PD or died prior to 6m and were excluded. 20 pts were excluded due to short follow up. Across 477 pts, the median age was 77 (range 70-93) y. 66% had an ECOG PS 0-1. The median cycles given was 6 (range 1-9). 27.3% received pre-phase steroids.
 The median BMI was 25.5 (range 14.2-48.1). 8.1% had a fracture prior to DLBCL, and 9.1% had a history of osteopenia or osteoporosis. 5.7% were current smokers, 3% had rheumatoid arthritis, 13.5% had type (T) 2 diabetes (DM), and 4.5% had a history of excess alcohol. At baseline, 25.2% had PET or CT-assessed cortical bone involvement.
 Overall, there were 52 fractures, including 50 within 18m follow up. Cumulative fracture incidence was 6.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.4 - 8.9) at 6m, 9.5% (95% CI 7.1 - 12.6) at 12m and 11.5% (95% CI 8.8 - 14.9) at 18m (Fig A).
 6 pts had multiple fracture sites (2; n=5, 3; n=1). 32 (62%) had vertebral fracture(s). Thoracic (34% 20/59) and lumbar vertebral (27% 16/59) were dominant sites (Fig C). 7/52 fractures were at the site of DLBCL involvement, 17/52 were at a different site from initial bone DLBCL involvement, 27/52 were in pts without bone involvement and 1/52 was unknown.
 Univariable RFs included female sex (hazard ratio (HR) 1.89 (95% CI 1.05 - 3.28)), known osteopenia or osteoporosis (HR 2.64 (95% CI 1.32 - 5.29)), DLBCL-related fracture at diagnosis (HR 4.05 (95% CI 2.07 - 7.92) (Fig B). Initial bone involvement was only associated with an increased risk in pts with a DLBCL-related baseline fracture (95% CI HR 4.56 (2.27 - 9.17)) (Table 1). MVA showed that DLBCL-related baseline fracture (HR 4.32 (1.97 - 9.47)) was the only significant independent RF for fracture with low BMI (p=0.051) and smoking history (p=0.052) of borderline significance (Table 2).
 Conclusions
 This is the largest series to date to show there is a clinically relevant fracture risk in older DLBCL pts specifically receiving R-CHOP in early follow up. Our data have limitations inherent to a retrospective study including the potential for unknown confounders, missing data, and medical record misinterpretation. Prospective data is required to validate RFs identified which could enable targeting a high-risk population. An RCT is needed to determine the value of prophylactic intervention(s) in high risk pts.

 abstract = {Purpose of review This review article presents the most recent research on bone fragility in individuals with diabetes from a medical imaging perspective. Recent findings The widespread availability of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and trabecular bone score (TBS) software has led to recent assessments of bone fragility with this texture parameter in several studies of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), but in few of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). Although most studies show a trend of reduced TBS values in T2D independent of areal bone mineral density (aBMD) of the lumbar spine, some studies also show the limitations of TBS in both T2D and T1D. Given the limitations of DXA to assess bone strength and investigate the etiology of bone fragility in diabetes, more investigators are incorporating three-dimensional (3D) medical imaging techniques in their studies. Recent use of 3D medical imaging to assess bone fragility in the setting of diabetes has been mostly limited to a few cross-sectional studies predominantly incorporating high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Although HR-pQCT studies indicate higher tibial cortical porosity in subjects with T2D, results are inconsistent in T1D due to differences in study designs, sample sizes, and subject characteristics, among other factors. With respect to central CT, recent studies support a previous finding in the literature indicating femoral neck geometrical impairments in subjects with T2D and provide encouraging results for the incorporation of finite element analysis (FEA) to assess bone strength in studies of T2D. In the recent literature, there are no studies assessing bone fragility in T1D with QCT, and only two studies used pQCT reporting tibial and radial impairments in young women and children with T1D, respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has not been recently used in diabetic studies of bone fragility. Summary As bone fragility in diabetes is not explained by DXA-derived aBMD and given the limitations of cross-sectional studies, it is imperative to use 3D imaging techniques for longitudinal assessments of the density, quality, and microenvironment of bone to improve our understanding of the effects of diabetes on bone and reduce the risk of fracture in this large and vulnerable population of subjects with diabetes.},

Sarcopenia and obesity are significant risk factors for fractures, independent of osteoporosis. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of sarcopenia and obesity, as well as bone microstructure, according to osteoporotic status and fracture sites in older women with recent low-trauma fractures. This cross-sectional study included 135 community-dwelling postmenopausal women aged 65 and older, evaluated within six months of experiencing a low-trauma fracture (resulting from a fall from standing height or less) occurring at the humerus, proximal femur, vertebrae, pelvis, forearm, or ankle. Participants were recruited either prospectively through the Fracture Liaison Service (FLS) at the Bone Disease Department of Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) (n = 90) or retrospectively from the Geneva Retirees Cohort (GERICO) (n = 45). Bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition were assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), muscle strength was measured by handgrip strength (HGS), and bone microstructure was evaluated using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). The prevalence of sarcopenia varied, with the overall prevalence across all definitions being 25%. It was significantly higher in osteoporotic women than in women with normal BMD (39% versus 6%, respectively, p = 0.014) and osteopenia (39% versus 20% respectively, p < 0.05). The prevalence of obesity was 24%, with particularly high rates observed among women with normal BMD (61%) and those with ankle or humerus fractures (43%, and 38%, respectively). Notably, 33% of women with major osteoporotic fractures (MOF) presented with normal BMD and without sarcopenia or obesity. A significant proportion of women with apparent low-trauma MOF does not have osteoporosis nor alterations of body composition (sarcopenia or obesity). The determinants of fracture risk in these women remain unclear and further investigations are required to better address secondary fracture prevention in this context.},

 abstract = {Diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is associated with increased fracture risk that cannot be fully explained by traditional bone mineral density (BMD) measurements. Emerging evidence suggests that diabetes-induced alterations in bone microarchitecture, remodeling, and mechanoregulation contribute to skeletal fragility. However, the specific structural and functional changes in bone differ between T1DM and T2DM, and the mechanisms underlying these differences remain incompletely understood.Innovation in medical imaging and increasingly accessible computational power have made it possible to monitor changes in bone microarchitecture and measure the mechanical properties of bone via image-based finite element analysis. Moreover, longitudinal clinical studies have also shown that the combined use of high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) and micro-finite element analysis can be used to measure load-driven bone remodelling in vivo.This talk will present findings from a meta-analysis of high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) studies assessing diabetes-related differences in bone structure and a longitudinal cohort study, conducted with partners from the FIDELIO – Bone Health in Diabetes Innovative Training Network, examining bone remodeling and mechanoregulation in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).The meta-analysis synthesized data from 16 studies, encompassing 743 individuals with diabetes and 3,472 controls, to characterize the impact of T1DM and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on bone microarchitecture. Results revealed that T1DM is predominantly associated with adverse trabecular characteristics, whereas T2DM is linked to cortical deficits, with more pronounced deterioration at the radius than at the weight-bearing tibia. These findings suggest that mechanical loading may mitigate some diabetes-associated skeletal changes, emphasizing the role of mechanoregulation in bone fragility.Complementing these insights, a four-year longitudinal cohort study investigated bone remodeling dynamics and responsiveness to mechanical stimuli in individuals with T1DM and diabetic neuropathy. By integrating HR-pQCT imaging with micro-finite element analysis, the study found that T1DM is characterized by lower trabecular bone formation (47% reduction) and resorption (59% reduction) compared to controls. Furthermore, impaired mechanoregulation was evidenced by a reduced likelihood of bone formation and resorption in response to mechanical strain, with these deficits correlating with nerve conduction amplitude and glycated hemoglobin levels.Together, these studies provide a mechanistic understanding of diabetes-associated skeletal fragility, highlighting distinct microarchitectural vulnerabilities in T1DM and T2DM and the role of neuropathy and metabolic control in bone remodeling.},

Introduction: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) confers an increased fracture risk, only partly explained by low areal bone mineral density (aBMD). We have previously shown in a cross-sectional study that bone microarchitecture is altered early in the course of T1D. The goal of this study is to evaluate how T1D influences longitudinal changes in volumetric BMD (vBMD) and microarchitecture. Methods: This is a 2-year prospective study of girls ages 10-16 years (62 with T1D and 59 controls). We used dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to measure aBMD, and high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) at the distal radius (7% site) and tibia (8% site) to measure vBMD and microarchitecture. We used linear mixed models to assess the effects of T1D on change in bone parameters over time, adjusting for bone age as an index of skeletal maturity, height, lean mass index (LMI), and fat mass index (FMI). Results: At baseline, mean duration of disease in T1D was 4.8 ± 3.2 years, and mean HbA1c was 8.6 ± 1.4%. The groups did not differ by age, bone age, and height, while T1D participants had higher LMI (p<0.001) and borderline higher FMI (p=0.107). Linear growth, weight gain, and changes in body composition over time did not differ between groups. Growth-mediated aBMD gains were observed in both groups at the subtotal body, total hip, femoral neck, and spine. While adjusted aBMD as well as trabecular bone score were lower in T1D, we did not observe between-group differences in changes in these endpoints over time. In both groups, at the distal radius, we observed significant increases over time in total and cortical vBMD, cortical thickness, trabecular (Tb) thickness, and estimated failure load, while cortical porosity decreased. While several microarchitectural parameters were altered in T1D participants, we did not observe significant between-group differences in changes in these measures over time. Of note, trabecular development was subtly altered, with T1D participants demonstrating a borderline significant decrease in Tb vBMD (-14.3 ± 9.0 mg HA/cm3, p=0.112) and Tb number (-0.14 ± 0.07 mm-[1], p=0.057), while control participants had no change in Tb vBMD or number, but a significant increase in Tb thickness (5.8 ± 2.5 µm, p=0.018). At the distal tibia, we observed similar overall detrimental effects of T1D at baseline. However, we did not observe between-group differences in microarchitectural change over time. Glycemic control as measured by HbA1c was not associated with changes in skeletal parameters among T1D participants. Conclusions: T1D leads to substantially altered areal and volumetric BMD as well as microarchitectural parameters in girls. While our data suggest that much of this deficit appears to occur early in the course of disease as prospective change is similar in T1D and controls, subtle changes in trabecular bone development at the radius may indicate ongoing impairment of bone accrual.

 abstract = {In their comment to my recent Editorial entitled ‘Osteosarcopenia: A Geriatric Giant of the XXI Century” (1), the authors narrowed their observations to the epidemiological aspects of this recently described geriatric syndrome. An important consideration the authors failed to mention is that all four prospective cohort studies and the cross-sectional study cited in their comment used DXA-derived lean mass measurements in the definitions of osteosarcopenia/ sarcopenia. Despite our recommendation to use DXA-lean mass in the osteosarcopenia definitions due to its wide use in clinical settings (2), we are aware that DXA-lean mass is a surrogate measure of muscle mass and not an accurate measure when compared to other imaging modalities (MRI/pQCT/ HR-pQCT) (3). Indeed, recent work from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (n = 1,425, age 77-101 years) showed that while accurate measures of muscle mass (measured by creatine dilution) are strongly associated with incident mobility disability, falls and mortality, DXA-appendicular lean mass (including adjustments for height squared and BMI) are not (4, 5). Thus, the prospective cohort studies cited in the comment have not tested the interactions using accurate measures of muscle mass with bone density/structure. Given the wellknown mechanical and metabolic relationship between muscle and bone, there is a strong biological rationale to test this hypothesis through a robust longitudinal study design, as we have previously suggested (1, 2). Still, based on currently available evidence, multiple groups worldwide (including ours) are investigating whether osteosarcopenia implies a greater risk of fractures, mortality, and falls (6), a question that deserves further exploration and that highlights the importance of identifying these two conditions in clinical practice, while understanding the limitations of current studies and looking forward to the results of several ongoing longitudinal cohorts in the field, which are using more accurate and sensitive structural and clinical methods to identify osteopenia/osteoporosis and sarcopenia in older persons. A particularly concerning element of this comment is the authors’ indistinguishable use of the terms “disease” and “geriatric syndrome”. The concept of geriatric syndromes, which is universally taught during early training years in geriatric medicine, is defined as “highly prevalent in older persons, multifactorial, and associated with substantial morbidity and poor outcomes” (7), which is clearly the case of osteosarcopenia, a syndrome whose recognition has been affected by research and clinical silos and fragmented models of care. The intention of the Editorial was not to “create a new disease” as stated by the authors, which is unnecessary considering that both osteoporosis and sarcopenia are wellrecognised diseases, but to increase awareness of the existence of a geriatric syndrome (Geriatric Giant) that “could become the unifier concept that will finally improve care to these devastating conditions”.},

 abstract = {CONTEXT
Impaired bone microarchitecture, assessed by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT), may contribute to bone fragility in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) but data on men are lacking.


OBJECTIVE
To investigate the association between T2DM and HR-pQCT parameters in older men.


METHODS
HR-pQCT scans were acquired on 1794 participants in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study. T2DM was ascertained by self-report or medication use. Linear regression models, adjusted for age, race, BMI, limb length, clinic site, and oral corticosteroid use, were used to compare HR-pQCT parameters by diabetes status.


RESULTS
Among 1777 men, 290 had T2DM (mean age 84.4 years). T2DM men had smaller total cross-sectional area (Tt.AR) at the distal tibia (p=0.028) and diaphyseal tibia (p=0.025), and smaller cortical area at the distal (p= 0.009) and diaphyseal tibia (p= 0.023). Trabecular indices and cortical porosity were similar between T2DM and non-T2DM. Among men with T2DM, in a model including HbA1c, diabetes duration, and insulin use, diabetes duration ≥ 10 years, compared with <10 years, was significantly associated with higher cortical porosity but with higher trabecular thickness at the distal radius. Insulin use was significantly associated with lower cortical area and thickness at the distal radius and diaphyseal tibia and lower failure load at all three scan sites. Lower cortical area, cortical thickness, total BMD, cortical BMD, and failure load of the distal sites were associated with increased risk of incident non-vertebral fracture in T2DM.


CONCLUSIONS
Older men with T2DM have smaller bone size compared to non-T2DM, which may contribute to diabetic skeletal fragility. Longer diabetes duration was associated with higher cortical porosity and insulin use with cortical bone deficits and lower failure load.},

 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) often leads to mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD), which compromise bone quality and increase fracture risk. These bone complications frequently persist after kidney transplantation (K-Tx), primarily due to the lingering effects of pre-existing CKD-MBD. Our aim was to evaluate CKD-MBD biomarkers, bone turnover markers, vitamin K-dependent protein (VKDP) levels, and bone microarchitecture using HR-pQCT at the time of K-Tx (T0) and 12 months post-transplant (T2). The main objective was to establish the association between VKDPs and HR-pQCT-derived bone quality parameters.
 
 
 
 We analyzed data from a cohort of 61 K-Tx patients: mean age 50.9 ± 13.3 years, 67% male, 25 patients (41%) underwent pre-emptive K-Tx, median dialysis duration 12 months (36 patients, 59%), diabetes prevalence 25%, fracture history 32%. The median cumulative total steroid dose was 1194 mg of prednisone equivalent. The following CKD-MBD serum biomarkers and bone turnover markers were measured: 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D, PTH, Bone ALP, P1NP, CTX, cFGF23, Klotho, IGF1, phosphate, calcium. Vitamin K-related proteins included Bone Gla Protein (BGP), undercarboxylated BGP (ucBGP), Matrix Gla Protein, and dephosphorylated-uc MGP (dp-ucMGP). In addition to HR-pQCT of the tibia and radius, DEXA scans of the lumbar spine, hip, and radius were performed at baseline and 12 months post-K-Tx. Spearman correlation (ρ, rho) was assessed between the percentage change in VKDPs, bone biomarkers (PTH, cFGF23), bone turnover markers (P1NP, CTX, Bone ALP), and the percentage change in HR-pQCT parameters of the tibia and radius.
 
 
 
 Significant improvements were observed in all CKD-MBD biomarkers and bone turnover markers 12 months post-transplant, except for Bone ALP and Klotho levels. PTH decreased from 100 to 27 ng/L, and CTX from 1524 to 246 pg/ml (Fig. 1). VKDP levels also showed significant improvement. The prevalence of vitamin K deficiency, based on a cut-off level of uc-BGP ≥4.5 ng/ml, decreased from 77% to 32% (P < 0.01, Delta % [median and IQR]: −55.22 [−69.50, −24.33]). Using a cut-off level of dp-uc MGP >500 pmol/L, the prevalence of vitamin K deficiency decreased non-significantly from 97% to 79% (P = 0.06). Our findings indicate significant inverse correlations between % Δ uc-BGP and Radius Total Volumetric BMD (r = −0.37, P < 0.05), Failure Load (r = −0.51, P < 0.05), and Stiffness (r = −0.49, P < 0.05). However, correlations between % Δ uc-BGP and Tibial parameters, including Tibial Total Volumetric BMD (r = −0.08), Failure Load (r = −0.11), and Stiffness (r = −0.11), did not reach statistical significance (P > 0.05) (Fig. 2).
 
 
 
 Our data confirm an improvement in vitamin K status one year after K-Tx. Additionally, the inverse correlation between ucBGP and bone quality parameters assessed by HR-pQCT underscores the crucial role of BGP in bone health. To our knowledge, these are the first reported data in the literature.

 abstract = {Introduction Patients with type 1 diabetes has an increased risk of fracture. We wished to evaluate estimated bone strength in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes and assess peripheral bone geometry, volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and microarchitecture. Research design and methods In a cross-sectional study, high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT (HR-pQCT) was performed of the radius and tibia in 84 children with type 1 diabetes and 55 healthy sibling controls. Estimated bone strength was assessed using a microfinite element analysis solver. Multivariate regression analyses were performed adjusting for age, sex, height and body mass index. Results The median age was 13.0 years in the diabetes group vs 11.5 years in healthy sibling controls. The median (range) diabetes duration was 4.2 (0.4−15.9) years; median (range) latest year Hb1Ac was 7.8 (5.9−11.8) % (61.8 (41−106) mmol/mol). In adjusted analyses, patients with type 1 diabetes had reduced estimated bone strength in both radius, β −390.6 (−621.2 to −159.9) N, p=0.001, and tibia, β −891.9 (−1321 to −462.9) N, p<0.001. In the radius and tibia, children with type 1 diabetes had reduced cortical area, trabecular vBMD, trabecular number and trabecular bone volume fraction and increased trabecular inhomogeneity, adjusted p<0.05 for all. Latest year HbA1c was negatively correlated with bone microarchitecture (radius and tibia), trabecular vBMD and estimated bone strength (tibia). Conclusion Children with type 1 diabetes had reduced estimated bone strength. This reduced bone strength could partly be explained by reduced trabecular bone mineral density, adverse microarchitecture and reduced cortical area. We also found increasing latest year HbA1c to be associated with several adverse changes in bone parameters. HR-pQCT holds potential to identify early adverse bone changes and to explain the increased fracture risk in young patients with type 1 diabetes.},

@article{gazzotti2024,
 abstract = {Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a rare phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous group of inherited skeletal dysplasias. The hallmark features of OI include bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures, bone deformity, and diminished growth, along with a plethora of associated secondary features (both skeletal and extraskeletal). The diagnosis of OI is currently made on clinical grounds and may be confirmed by genetic testing. However, imaging remains pivotal in the evaluation of this disease. The aim of this article is to review the current role played by the various radiologic techniques in the diagnosis and monitoring of OI in the postnatal setting as well as to discuss recent advances and future perspectives in OI imaging. Conventional Radiography and Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) are currently the two most used imaging modalities in OI. The cardinal radiographic features of OI include generalized osteopenia/osteoporosis, bone deformities, and fractures. DXA is currently the most available technique to assess Bone Mineral Density (BMD), specifically areal BMD (aBMD). However, DXA has important limitations and cannot fully characterize bone fragility in OI based on aBMD. Novel DXA-derived parameters, such as Trabecular Bone Score (TBS), may provide further insight into skeletal changes induced by OI, but evidence is still limited. Techniques like Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can be useful as problem-solvers or in specific settings, including the evaluation of cranio-cervical abnormalities. Recent evidence supports the use of High-Resolution peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR-pQCT) as a promising tool to improve the characterization of bone fragility in OI. However, HR-pQCT remains a primarily research technique at present. Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) is an alternative to DXA for the determination of BMD at central sites, with distinct advantages but considerably higher radiation exposure. Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) is a portable, inexpensive, and radiation-free modality that may complement DXA evaluation, providing information on bone quality. However, evidence of usefulness of QUS in OI is poor. Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry (REMS) is an emerging non-ionizing imaging method that holds promise for the diagnosis of low BMD and for the prediction of fracture risk, but so far only one published study has investigated its role in OI. To conclude, several different radiologic techniques have proven to be effective in the diagnosis and monitoring of OI, each with their own specificities and peculiarities. Clinicians should be aware of the strategic role of the various modalities in the different phases of the patient care process. In this scenario, the development of international guidelines including recommendations on the role of imaging in the diagnosis and monitoring of OI, accompanied by continuous active research in the field, could significantly improve the standardization of patient care.},

Methods Phase 3, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled study randomised women and men ≥18 years, receiving GC (≥7.5 mg prednisone daily or equivalent) for <3 (GC-initiating [GC-I]) or ≥3 months (GC-continuing [GC–C]), to DMAb 60 mg every 6 months or RIS 5 mg daily for 24 months. Subjects <50 years had a history of osteoporosis (OP) fracture. GC-C subjects ≥50 years had lumbar spine, total hip or femoral neck BMD T–score ≤–2.0; or T-score ≤–1.0 with history of OP fracture. All subjects were to receive daily calcium (≥1000 mg) and vitamin D (≥800 IU). In a subset, HR-pQCT scans of the distal radius and distal tibia were performed at baseline and Months 12 and 24. Treatment differences (DMAb–RIS) were estimated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Results The substudy enrolled 111 subjects (57 DMAb, 54 RIS). DMAb was associated with significantly greater increases than RIS in cortical thickness, total volumetric BMD (vBMD) and cortical vBMD at the radius and tibia at 12 and 24 months, and in trabecular vBMD at the radius at 12 months and tibia at 24 months (Table).

 abstract = {Background The expanding population of older adults with obesity is a public health challenge, in part, because of the increased risk of fractures despite normal or high bone mineral density. Potential factors predisposing to fractures in this group include sarcopenia associated with obesity and impaired bone quality. We aimed to determine the contribution of sarcopenic obesity (SO) indices to bone strength as assessed by microfinite element analysis (μFEA) of high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Methods One-hundred eighty-nine older (age ≥ 65 years) adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) participated in lifestyle intervention trials at our medical center. All underwent baseline measurements of bone strength (failure load and stiffness) using μFEA from HR-pQCT of the distal radius and tibia. In addition, SO indices [appendicular lean mass/weight (ALM/W) and percent body fat (FM%)] by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and handgrip strength (HGS) by dynamometry were assessed. SO was diagnosed and staged based on the 2022 ESPEN and EASO expert consensus statement. Results Both ALM/W and HGS were positively correlated explaining 28% to 36% of the variance in failure load and stiffness at the distal radius and tibia (all p < 0.001). In contrast, FM% was negatively correlated explaining 22% to 31% of the variance in failure load and stiffness at the distal radius and tibia (all p < 0.001). The associations of SO indices with failure load and stiffness remained significant after controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, diabetes, and 25-OH vitamin D (ALM/W: R 2 = 0.301 to 0.448, HGS: R 2 = 0.346 to 0.472, FM%: R 2 = 0.299 to 0.432) (p < 0.001 to 0.011). SO was diagnosed in 75/189 (40%) participants with 66/75 (88%) having functional or metabolic complications (stage II). Participants with SO had lower failure load and stiffness at the distal radius than participants with no SO (both p < 0.05). Conclusion These findings demonstrate that lower muscle mass and strength and higher fat mass may impair bone quality.

 abstract = {Background Older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have an increased risk of bone fracture independent of their bone mineral density (BMD), which is explained mainly by the deteriorated bone quality in T2DM compared to that in non-diabetic adults. Sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitors have been studied in several trials in T2DM, and the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study showed an increased fracture risk related to treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin, although no evidence of increased fracture risk with treatment with other SGLT2 inhibitors has been reported. The mechanism of the difference in the fracture risk between the SGLT2 inhibitors is unknown, but the differences among the SGLT2 inhibitors in the selectivity of SGLT2 against SGLT1 may affect bone metabolism, since among the SGLT2 inhibitors the selectivity of canagliflozin is lowest. We will investigate whether the SGLT2 inhibitor luseogliflozin, which has the higher SGLT2 selectivity, affects bone metabolism by using high-resolution, peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) which provides direct in vivo morphometric information about the bone microarchitecture. Methods/design This is a single-center, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, parallel pilot trial. Eligible participants are older (age ≥ 60 years) individuals with T2DM with HbA1c levels at 7.0–8.9%. A total of 24 participants will be allocated to either the luseogliflozin group (taking luseogliflozin) or the control group (taking metformin) in a 1:1 ratio to compare the groups’ changes in bone microarchitecture of the radius and tibia which are analyzed by HR-pQCT before and at 48 weeks after the administration of each medication. The laboratory data associated with glycemic control and bone metabolism will be collected every 12 weeks during the study. Recruitment began in June 2019. Discussion The reason that we use metformin as an active control is to avoid yielding differences in glycemic control between the luseogliflozin and control groups. Besides, metformin is considered to have a neutral effect on bone. This trial should reveal the effect of luseogliflozin on bone metabolism in older patients with T2DM. Trial registration The study was registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network ( UMIN000036202 ) on 1 April 2019 and with the Japan Registry of Clinicla Trials ( jRCTs071180061 ) on 14 March 2019.},

 abstract = {Summary Volumetric bone density (vBMD) and trabecular microarchitecture measured by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) can discriminate the patients with high risk of asymptomatic vertebral fracture (VF) in postmenopausal Chinese women. These findings suggested that HR-pQCT could provide additional information on bone quality of the patients with asymptomatic VF. Introduction Although there were several studies using HR-pQCT to investigate asymptomatic VF, it remains uncertain if HR-pQCT parameters can discriminate asymptomatic VF patients, especially in Chinese population. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether bone quality measured by HR-pQCT could discriminate asymptomatic VF independent of hip areal bone mineral density (aBMD) measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and fracture risks evaluated using built-in Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX BMD ). Methods This is a nested case–control study. One hundred seventy-five ambulatory Chinese postmenopausal women aged 60–79 years were retrieved from Normative Reference Standards (NRS) cohort in Hong Kong. DXA was used to identify VF from lateral spine images (VFA) using Genant’s semi-quantitative method. Major osteoporotic fracture risk was calculated using FRAX tool. HR-pQCT was used to assess vBMD, microarchitecture, and estimated strength at both distal radius and tibia. Comparison of HR-pQCT parameters between asymptomatic VF and control was performed using covariance analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed for calculating the adjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of fracture status as per SD decrease in HR-pQCT parameters. Results Women with asymptomatic VF were older than those of the control in our NRS cohort. Nevertheless, after adjusted for covariance, asymptomatic VF showed significantly lower trabecular vBMD (Tb.vBMD) at radius but higher SMI at tibia as compared with those of the control. Tb.vBMD at radius yielded the highest value of area under the curve (AUC) as compared with total hip aBMD and FRAX BMD . However, no significant difference was found among each other. Conclusion Tb.vBMD at the radius and SMI at the tibia provided by HR-pQCT can discriminate asymptomatic VF independent of hip aBMD and FRAX BMD by DXA in postmenopausal women.},

 abstract = {Introduction and Objective: Fracture risk in type 1 diabetes (T1D) involves lower bone mineral density (BMD) and deterioration of bone microarchitecture, but data in Asians is limited. We investigated bone microarchitecture and its associated factors in Japanese with T1D using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT).
 Methods: We recruited individuals with T1D aged ≥20 years, who had not been treated with anti-osteoporosis drugs. Microstructures in distal radius and tibia were evaluated by HR-pQCT (Xtreme CT II®) in subjects with T1D and those without diabetes, matching 1:1 for age, sex, height, and BMI.
 Results: 58 adults with T1D (age 52±13 ys, duration 14±12 ys) were enrolled. In trabecular (Tb) bone in tibia, compared to non-diabetes, T1D subjects showed significant decreases in volumetric BMD (vBMD) and Tb number (Tb.N), and a significant increase in Tb separation (Tb.Sp). No significant differences were observed in cortical (Ct) values of tibia between T1D and non-diabetes. All Tb/Ct values of radius showed a similar tendency to those of tibia, but without significant differences between T1D and non-diabetes. Age was negatively correlated with Tb.vBMD and Tb.N, and positively correlated with Tb.Sp. Total insulin dose was negatively and positively correlated with Tb.N and Tb.Sp, respectively. Deterioration of Ct bone in vBMD, thickness, and porosity was observed in subjects complicated with neuropathy. In sub-analysis of males, in addition to Tb finding observed in all subjects, Ct vBMD and Ct thickness were significantly decreased in T1D than non-diabetes. Complications of neuropathy or retinopathy showed significant effects on Tb and Ct deterioration in males but not females.
 Conclusion: T1D is associated with microarchitectural deterioration in Tb rather than Ct bone, with a stronger impact in males. Microvascular complications may accelerate the risk especially in males.

Little is known about the potential impact of weight loss on cortical and trabecular bone density, microarchitecture, and strength. In this study, participants were members of the Framingham Offspring Cohort (769 women, 595 men; mean age 70 ± 8 years), who underwent high‐resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR‐pQCT) scanning at the tibia and radius in 2012 to 2016. Weight measurements taken every 4 to 6 years were used to assess recent weight change over 6 years and long‐term change over 40 years. General linear models, adjusting for age, sex, height, smoking, and diabetes, were used to evaluate the association between HR‐pQCT indices and relative long‐term and recent weight change. We found that long‐term and recent weight loss were associated with lower cortical density and thickness, higher cortical porosity, and lower trabecular density and number. Associations were stronger for the tibia than radius. Failure load was lower in those individuals with long‐term but not short‐term weight loss. Deterioration in both cortical and trabecular indices, especially at the weight‐bearing skeleton, characterizes bone fragility associated with long‐term and recent weight loss in older adults. © 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.},

 Both adult and pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis, nevertheless, whether patients with IBD are subjected to a higher risk for bone fractures is debated. Thus, we aimed to assess the risk for bone fractures, osteopenia and osteoporosis in IBD vs non-IBD patients, using the epi-Israeli IBD Research Nucleus (IIRN) data.
 
 
 
 Data of patients with IBD and non-IBD matched controls (approximately 3 non-IBD controls per case) were retrieved from the epi-IIRN cohort (January 2005- June 2020) that maintain data on all patients with IBD from the four Israeli HMOs. Data included demographics, osteoporosis medications, fracture data and IBD related characteristics. Patients were stratified by age group (0-17,18-49, and ≥50). Patients with known osteopenia or osteoporosis before IBD diagnosis were excluded.
 
 
 
 We included 32,263 patients with IBD and 89,423 non-IBD controls [48% female, 56% Crohn’s disease (CD)]. Time to first fracture was significantly shorter in female pediatric patients (p=0.01), in both female (p=0.0004) and male (p=0.003) adult and elderly patients (p<0.0001) (Figure 1). Time to diagnosis of osteopenia/osteoporosis in patients with IBD was significantly shorter in all age groups and genders. Rate of fractures was significantly higher in patients with IBD versus controls for all groups, and rate of osteopenia/osteoporosis was also higher in patients with IBD in all groups (Table 1). In a subgroup analysis, fracture rate did not significantly differ between CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) for all age groups, but osteopenia and osteoporosis were significantly higher in CD compared to UC in all age groups. The hazard ratio for fractures in the pediatric IBD population was 1.02 (0.88-1.16) for males and 1.17(0.95-1.44) for females, in adults 1.08 (0.99-1.16) for males and 1.12 (1.02-1.21) for females, and in the elderly 1.2 (1.08-1.32) for males and 1.19 (1.08-1.31) for females. Arthritis was significantly associated with fracture risk [HR: children 1.47 (1.15-1.88); adults 1.3 (1.17-1.44); elderly 1.19 (1.07-1.30)]. In adults and elderly, older age at diagnosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes and long-term proton pump inhibitors usage were also associated with a significant increase in fracture risk.
 
 
 
 In this large nationwide cohort, patients with IBD had significantly higher risk for bone fractures than matched controls in almost all age groups, with no difference between CD and UC. Additionally, the rate of osteopenia and osteoporosis was higher in patients with IBD, suggesting that further efforts need to be invested in bone health of this at-risk population.

All patients had a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan (Delphi densitometer; Hologic, Bedford, USA) performed between the years 2004-2008 and were followed in the rheumatology clinics by the same team of physicians. The incidence of new MACEs, which were defined as ischemic vascular events (acute coronary syndrome, stroke, peripheral vascular disease) documented by imaging and angiographic studies, was evaluated. Patients were stratified into 2 groups according to the presence of osteoporosis at baseline, which was defined as a DXA T score of <-2.5 or Z score <-2.0 at the hip, femoral neck or lumbar spine, or having a past history of fragility fractures. The effect of osteoporosis on the development of MACEs and mortality was studied by Cox regression analysis, adjusted for demographic characteristics, traditional cardiovascular risk factors, antiphospholipid antibodies and the use of medications.383 SLE patients were studied (age at DXA scan 40.5±13 years; 94% women; SLE duration 8.0±7.4 years). Osteoporosis at the hip, femoral neck or spine at baseline was present in 105 patients (13 with old fragility fractures) and 8 patients had osteopenia and past fragility fractures. The demographic characteristics, prevalence of traditional atherosclerotic risk factors and antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies (lupus anticoagulant or moderate/high titers of IgG-anticardiolipin antibodies) were not significantly different between those with osteoporosis/fracture (N=113) and without (N=270). Patients with osteoporosis/fracture were more likely to be using glucocorticoids (79% vs 62%; p=0.002) and mycophenolate mofetil/azathioprine/calcineurin inhibitors (58% vs 48%; p=0.08) but less likely to be treated with hydroxychloroquine (40% vs 51%; p=0.051) at baseline. Over a follow-up of 153±41 months, 44 new MACEs (acute coronary syndrome [n=19]; ischemic stroke [n=19]; peripheral vascular disease with digital gangrene/amputation [n=6]) developed in 42 patients. The incidence of MACEs was significantly higher in patients with osteoporosis/fracture than those without (1.59 vs 0.63/100 patient-years; p=0.001). The cumulative risk of MACEs at 3, 5 and 10 years was 6.3%, 11.7%, 14.7%, and 0.4%, 1.9%, 4.7%, respectively, in the osteoporosis and non-osteoporosis groups (log rank test; p=0.002; univariate hazard ratio 2.58[1.40-4.74]; p=0.002). In a Cox regression model, osteoporosis/fracture remained an independent risk factor for the development of MACEs after adjustment for age, sex, LDL level, atherogenic index, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, past MACE, aPL antibodies, smoking, obesity and the use medications that included immunosuppressive drugs, aspirin/warfarin, statins, vitamin D and bisphosphonates (HR 2.41[1.25-4.67]; p=0.009). At last follow-up, 62(16%) patients succumbed (MACEs in 8 patients [vascular mortality], infective complications in 27 patients, cancer in 10 patients). Osteoporosis/fracture was associated with vascular mortality (HR 11.1[1.02-120]; p=0.048) but not with all-cause mortality (HR 1.55[0.89-2.68]; p=0.12) after adjustment for the same covariates in separate multivariate models.Osteoporosis increases the risk of MACEs and vascular mortality in patients with SLE, which is not accounted by traditional vascular risk factors. Elevation of inflammatory cytokines in SLE that are common to bone metabolism and atherosclerotic vascular disease may be responsible.None declared},

 abstract = {Background: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is characterized by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β- cells with consequent absolute insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia. Adult patients with T1D have a sixfold increased fracture risk. However, this increase in fracture risk in T1D patients could not be explained by BMD alone. As far as skeletal microarchitecture in T1D is concerned, data is sparse in world literature and absent in Indian population. Hence, we aimed to study the skeletal microarchitecture in T1D subjects as assessed by High Resolution Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR-pQCT) and compared these parameters with age, sex and BMI matched controls. Methods: We recruited 31 T1D cases without celiac disease (Group A: Male15, Female 16), 11 T1D cases with celiac disease (Group B: Male 5, Female 6) and 19 age, sex and BMI matched healthy control (Group C: Male 10, Female 9). Blood biochemistry and hormonal profile including calcium profile, 25(OH) vitamin D, iPTH and HbA1C level between the Group A and B were compared. The HR-pQCT parameters among the three groups were also compared. Results: The median age of male and female participants in Group A [22 (20-25) years and 23 (22-26) years], Group B [26 (22-31) and 23 (21-24) years] and Group C [27 (18-28) years and 26 (25-27) years] were comparable. BMI was also comparable between the three groups. The duration of diabetes, insulin dose per kg body weight, calcium profile, 25(OH) vitamin DandiPTH level were similar between Group A and B. Median HbA1C value in male and female subjects within Group A and B were 7.05 (6.4-8.0)% and 8.2 (7.2-10.2) %, 8.2 (6.4-9.6) %, and 9.2 (7.9-12.3) %, respectively; and when sex specific comparison was done, the differences were statistically insignificant. Radial cortical vBMD (volumetric BMD) was significantly higher in male subjects in Group B as compared to male cases in Group C. Tibial trabecular vBMD in female participants was significantly lower in Group B as compared to Group C. Tibial trabecular bone volume fraction in female was greater in Group C as compared to the other groups. Trabecular thickness in femaletibiawas also greater in Group C compared to other two groups; while, trabecular thickness of female radius was higher in Group C compared to Group A. Conclusions: Skeletal microarchitecture is altered in T1D subjects with and without celiac disease. This may explain higher skeletal fragility in this subgroup of patients.},

Introduction: Familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL) is a rare condition with genetic diversity, characterized by the deficiency of adipose tissue in the lower limbs and gluteus, insulin resistance and metabolic alterations. Although the relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and fracture risk is well established, there is a scarcity of data on the association between fracture risk and FPL.Objective: To assess the risk of fractures in patients with FPL by bone mineral density and microarchitecture, as well as possible factors involved in this association. Methods: Cross-sectional study that selected patients from an outpatient clinic for FPL and controls from a database of healthy individuals. Clinical evaluation and examinations were made by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and high-resolution quantitative peripheral computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Results: 24 patients were included in the FPL group, while 20 controls. FPL group with a mean age of 43.4 years (± 11.9) and median body mass index (BMI) of 25.3 (22.5 - 39.2) kg/m². In the control group, the mean age was 39.4 (± 6.4) and median BMI of 25.6 (22 - 37.6) kg/m². There was no significant difference between groups with respect to age (p 0.185) and BMI (p 0.506). In the FPL group, 15 participants had a diagnosis of DM, with a mean disease duration of 16.5 years (± 7.4). Molecular analysis in FPL group did not identify mutations in two patients, while 10 presented LMNA variant, 4 patients LPL (heterozygous), 3 with PPARG, 2 presented AKT in association with LMNA variant. Rare variants in one patient each as BSCL2 (heterozygous), MFN2 and SPINK1. Regarding DEXA, there was a statistical difference in the Z-score of the spine and femur, with higher values in the FPL group. Evaluating HR-pQCT in the tibia and radius, there was no statistical difference in the comparison between the two groups. A comparison between the FPL subgroup with DM and the controls showed a statistical difference in the radius trabecular thickness parameter (Tb.Th), with greater Tb.Th in the FPL group with DM (median 0.078 mm versus 0.065 mm - p 0.048). This subgroup has a median of the highest triglyceride level of 1234 mg/dl, while the median of subgroup without DM is 371 mg/dl (p 0.028). Two patients presented femur fracture after falling from their own height during the study - after 20 years of diagnosis of DM and additional risk factors for frailty. Conclusion: Although the data does not indicate a higher risk of fractures in patients with FPL compared to controls and a greater Tb.Th was identified in the HR-pQCT evaluation in the subgroup of 15 patients with DM in relation to the control, two patients with DM presented osteoporotic fractures. The results suggest that hyperinsulinemia may have an anabolic effect on the bone, but with an evolution of greater bone fragility as the disease progresses to DM with complications and other associated risk factors for fracture.

 abstract = {Abstract Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) increases the risk of fracture at any given bone mineral density (BMD). However, the optimal strategy for osteoporosis screening with DXA is unknown in those with DM. A previously described strategy in the general population known as “Opportunistic Osteoporosis Screening” uses computer tomography (CT) images done for other reasons to assess the attenuation (density) of L1 in Hounsfield units (HU)—this was found to correlate with DXA-derived T-score. However, neither the methodology nor the cut-points have been specifically validated in those with DM. Thus, the goal of this study was to examine the performance of this methodology and define thresholds corresponding with low BMD in those with DM. Methods: This was retrospective study using electronic medical record data. Patients with DM were identified by ICD code. Those with both abdominal CT and DXA within a 6-month period were included, excluding patients with CKD stage 5, solid organ transplantation, bariatric surgery, or L1 hardware. L1 attenuation, measured by 2 readers on sagittal view, were averaged. A different reader assessed for vertebral fractures. Fractures of the hip, forearm, humerus, and pelvis were identified by ICD code. The lowest T-score of lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip, or forearm (available in 11 subjects) was used to compare to L1 attenuation. ROC curves were derived from univariate logistic regression. Results: 320 subjects met study criteria; 10 (3.2%) had vertebral fractures, 8 (2.6%) had prior major non-vertebral fracture, and 33 (10.3%) had osteoporosis by BMD. The 18 subjects with major fractures had lower T-scores (-2.3 ± 1.4 vs. -0.8 ± 1.4, p<0.001) and lower L1 attenuation (104 ± 46 vs. 149 ± 47 HU, p<0.001). T-score and L1 attenuation had similar discrimination for prior fracture by area under the ROC curve (0.77 vs. 0.76, p=NS). Moderate osteopenia (T-score -1.5 or less) and L1 attenuation of 130 HU or less had identical sensitivities (72.2% for both) and similar specificities (69.2% vs. 62.5%, respectively) for prior fracture. In regards to L1 attenuation corresponding to DXA diagnosis of osteoporosis, 160 HU was 94% sensitive, while 110 HU was 80% specific. This is similar to the 90% sensitivity for 160 HU and 90% specificity for 110 HU previously reported in the general population. Given higher fracture risk in DM, moderate osteopenia (n=106) was also examined as an outcome: 130 HU was 61% sensitive and 71% specific. This threshold had similar or improved sensitivity and specificity among subgroups of insulin users, men, and women under age 65. Conclusion: Our results validate the use of opportunistic osteoporosis screening in patients with DM, which could help clinicians decide on the need for screening DXA. Patients with diabetes and L1 attenuation below 130 HU on CT scan should be considered for DXA screening to formally assess the risk of fracture.},

 abstract = {Introduction. The combination of cardiovascular pathology with osteoporosis and fractures in men, especially at a younger age, requires the study of the causes and risk factors for the strategy of early diagnosis, treatment and prevention. Target. To study the clinical and pathogenetic relationships of cardiovascular pathology with the risk of fractures in men over 45 years of age. Materials and methods: 201 men over the age of 45 were examined, mean age 51.1 [46.1; 56.3]. The accuracy and statistical significance of the distribution of groups was assessed using discriminant analysis. High values of canonical correlation (Canonic.R=0.941) and chi-square test (χ²=630.4) with zero probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis (p=0.000) and coincidence of the results of discrimination and cluster analysis in 95% of cases made it possible to assume the reliability of the model , built on the basis of the proposed variables. Results. The frequency of risk factors in the examined patients was: smoking - 107 people. (53.2%), abdominal obesity 74 people. (36.8%); arterial hypertension - 75 people. (37.3%), hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol> 5.0 mmol / l) - 39 people. (19.4%), increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL cholesterol)> 3.0 mmol / l - 32 people. (15.9%), hypertriglyceridemia (TG> 1.7 mmol / l) - 27 people. (13.4%); fasting glycemia or diabetes mellitus - 28 people. (13.9%). Among patients with fractures, men with an increased body mass index (26.5±3.3 kg/m² and 24.1±4.5 kg/m² p=0.008) and abdominal obesity (104.1±7.0 and 100.1±6.2 cm, p=0.004), vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency (37 (18.4%) versus 4 (1.9%) p=0.000) and androgen deficiency (15 (7 .4%) and 7 (3.4%) p=0.048). Fractures were significantly more often associated with diabetes mellitus (19 (9.4%) and 4 (1.9%) p=0.029), respectively. Based on the identified factors, the discriminant analysis made it possible to build a mathematical model for predicting fractures in men over 45 years of age. The canonical correlation coefficient R was 0.841. Wilkson's lambda statistics values of 0.292 indicate good discrimination (with χ² - 223.7 p<0.01). The established most significant signs were assigned gradations (X1 - 6) and numerical values, where: X1 - history of fractures: no - 0, yes - 1; Х2 – age of the first fracture older than 50 years: no – 0, yes – 1; smoking: no - 0, yes - 1; diabetes mellitus: no - 0, yes - 1; walking less than 1 hour a day: no - 0, yes - 1; X6 - osteoporosis or osteopenia: no - 0, yes - 1. X1-X6 values are standardized initial data calculated by the formula: Z = (X I - X) / s, where Z - initial distribution values, X I - results dimensions of the distribution with the original dimension. The values of the constants F1 and F2 are determined: F1 = -5.99; F2 = -4.54. Having established the gradations and numerical values of the risk factors, the predictive coefficients F1 and F2 are determined according to the following formulas: F1= -5.99–0.854×X1–0.192×X2+0.855×X3–0.179×X4+8.755×X5+3.904×X6. F2= –4.54+1.24×X1+ 2.94×X2+2.165×X3+1.60×X4–0.77×X5+5.75×X6. With an absolute value of F2 greater than the absolute value of F1, a high risk is predicted, and with an F2 value less than F1, a low risk of fractures in comorbid men is predicted. Conclusions. Among men in a random sample over 45 years of age, a high incidence of cardiovascular risk factors was established. A third of the examined men had bone fractures of various localization. The mathematical model makes it possible to predict the development of fractures in men over 45 years of age, the risk of which increases in the presence of the following risk factors: a history of fractures before the age of 50, physical inactivity, smoking, the presence of diabetes mellitus and osteoporosis according to x-ray osteodensitometry.},

People with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are at high-risk of fragility fractures, however, there are no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy/safety of anti-osteoporosis drugs as a primary endpoint in T2D (1). To address this lacuna, we conducted a pilot prospective, open-labeled, blinded-end point (PROBE) RCT (CTRI/2022/02/039978) wherein consecutive postmenopausal female (≥ 50 years) with T2D (duration ≥ 5 years) were screened. Subjects with HbA1c 7-10%, eGFR > 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 and prior history of vertebral (clinical/morphometric), hip, radius, humeral fragility fracture or at high-risk of fragility fractures [defined as areal bone mineral density (BMD) T-score (adjusted for diabetes) at lumbar spine/femoral neck ≤ -2.5 and high FRAX score] and without any secondary cause of osteoporosis were randomised in staggered fashion in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive either daily teriparatide, yearly zoledronate, biannually denosumab (in addition to standard of care, i.e., calcium 1000 mg/day and cholecalciferol 1000 IU/day) or only standard of care (control). The primary end points were change in areal BMD and frequency of incident fractures at 18 months. The secondary end point was change in HR-pQCT parameters measured at distal radius and distal tibia (XtremeCT II, SCANCO Medical AG, Switzerland) at 6 and 18 months.Out of 412 participants who were screened, 104 subjects were randomized to any of the 4 arms. Out of these 104 subjects, 53 have completed 6 months of follow-up (teriparatide n=14, zoledronate n=14, denosumab n=15, control n=10). There were no statistically significant differences in age, HbA1c, eGFR, calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, procollagen type I N-propeptide (PINP), C-terminal telopeptide (CTX), areal BMD, trabecular bone score (TBS), FRAX score or HR-pQCT parameters between the 4 groups at randomisation. At 6 months, there was no significant difference in HbA1c between the 4 groups; PINP and CTX rise was significantly higher in teriparatide arm compared to zoledronate, denosumab or control arms. With regard to HR-pQCT, there were no statistically significant differences in total [total volumetric BMD (vBMD), bone volume fraction], cortical (vBMD, thickness, porosity, pore diameter), or trabecular (vBMD, thickness, number, separation) bone properties at the distal radius and distal tibia between the 4 arms at 6 months of follow-up. To conclude, zoledronate, denosumab or teriparatide were unable to induce any significant microarchitectural changes than standard of care in postmenopausal women with T2D at high-risk of fragility fractures following 6 months of treatment. Longer duration of treatment and follow-up of the cohort is required to arrive at robust conclusions. Reference: (1) Pal et al., Bone fragility in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a lot left to explore.

 abstract = {Objective We investigated whether the evaluation of bone mineral density (BMD) provides independent and incremental prognostic value for predicting atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in women. Methods A total of 12 681 women aged 50–80 years (mean, 63.0±7.8 years) who underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were retrospectively analysed. We assessed the hazard ratio (HR) for ASCVD events (ASCVD death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke) according to the BMD or a clinical diagnosis of osteopenia or osteoporosis, with adjustment for clinical risk factors, including age, body mass index, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, current smoking and previous fracture. We also evaluated whether the addition of BMD or a clinical diagnosis of osteopenia or osteoporosis to clinical risk factors improved the prediction for ASCVD events. Results In total, 468 women (3.7%) experienced ASCVD events during follow-up (median, 9.2 years). Lower BMD at the lumbar spine, femur neck and total hip was independently associated with higher risk for ASCVD events (adjusted HR per 1-standard deviation decrease in BMD: 1.16, p<0.001; 1.29, p<0.001; 1.38, p<0.001; respectively). A clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis was also independently associated with higher risk for ASCVD events (adjusted HR: 1.79, p<0.001). The addition of BMD or a clinical diagnosis of osteopenia or osteoporosis to clinical risk factors demonstrated significant incremental value in discriminating ASCVD events (addition of total hip BMD, p for difference <0.001). Conclusion The evaluation of BMD provides independent and incremental prognostic value for ASCVD in women and thus may improve risk stratification in women.},

 abstract = {Background: There is an increased risk of fragility fractures in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Bone mineral density (BMD) as measured by DEXAmay be increased despite poor quality of bone and thus FRAX may underestimate the risk of fractures in this population. HR-pQCT is a non-invasive imaging modality for assessment of volumetric BMD (vBMD) and microarchitecture of cancellous and cortical bones. Also the available data regarding the choice of anti-osteoporotic therapy in T2DM are based on either preclinical studies or posthoc/subgroup analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with no head-to-head comparison. We aim to compare the efficacy of the three most commonly used anti-osteoporotic medications, namely, teriparatide, zoledronate and denosumab, in a cohort of postmenopausal women with T2DM at a high risk of incident fragility fractures. Methods: Here we present the interim analysis after 6 months of an open-labelled randomised control trial of 120 postmenopausal women with T2DM enrolled for 18 months follow-up. Patients were randomised into 4 groups in 1:1:1:1 ratio, with group Areceiving teriparatide, group B receiving zoledronate, Group C receiving denosumab each along with calcium and vitamin D supplements and group D receiving only calcium and vitamin D supplements. The objective was to determine the effects of the anti-osteoporotic drugs on HR-pQCT parameters at the end of 6 months compared to at the time of enrolment. Results: 31 patients who completed their 6 months follow-up were included in the analysis, 8 in group A, 7 in group B and D and 9 in group C. There were no significant change in the vBMD amongst the groups at 6 months at both tibia (p = 0.075) and radius (p = 0.067). There was a decrease in the total vBMD in all the 4 groups at tibia. However at the radius, total vBMD increased in group B and decreased in the rest, however the intra-group changes were not significant. There was a statistically significant difference in trabecular spacing at tibia between group A (increased) and group C (decreased) (p = 0.031). There were no significant changes in other bone microarchitecture parameters. Conclusion: At the end of 6 months, there were no significant changes in volumetric BMD and bone microarchitecture at both tibia and radius amongst the groups except for trabecular spacing. Larger number of patients with longer follow-up would help in further understanding.},

 abstract = {BackgroundImpaired bone quality is associated with poor outcome of spinal surgery. The aim of the study was to assess the bone mineral status of patients scheduled to undergo spinal surgery and to report frequencies of bone mineral disorders.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed the bone mineral status of 144 patients requiring spinal surgery including bone mineral density by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as well as laboratory data with serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D), parathyroid hormone, calcium, bone specific alkaline phosphate, osteocalcin, and gastrin. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) was additionally performed in a subgroup of 67 patients with T-Score below − 1.5 or history of vertebral fracture.ResultsAmong 144 patients, 126 patients (87.5%) were older than 60 years. Mean age was 70.1 years. 42 patients (29.1%) had suffered from a vertebral compression fracture. 12 previously undiagnosed vertebral deformities were detected in 12 patients by vertebral fracture assessment (VFA). Osteoporosis was present in 39 patients (27.1%) and osteopenia in 63 patients (43.8%). Only 16 patients (11.1%) had received anti-osteoporotic therapy, while 54 patients (37.5%) had an indication for specific anti-osteoporotic therapy but had not received it yet. The majority of patients had inadequate vitamin D status (73.6%) and 34.7% of patients showed secondary hyperparathyroidism as a sign for a significant disturbed calcium homeostasis. In a subgroup of 67 patients, severe vertebral deformities were associated with stronger deficits in bone microarchitecture at the distal radius compared to the distal tibia.ConclusionsThis study shows that bone metabolism disorders are highly prevalent in elderly patients scheduled for spinal surgery. Vertebral deformities are associated with a predominant deterioration of bone microstructure at the distal radius. As impaired bone quality can compromise surgical outcome, we strongly recommend an evaluation of bone mineral status prior to operation and anti-osteoporotic therapy if necessary.},

 abstract = {Bone fragility is a critical issue in the treatment of elderly people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). In the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study, the subjects with T2D who were treated with canagliflozin showed a significant increase in fracture events compared to a placebo group as early as 12 weeks post-initiation. In addition, it has been unclear whether sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors promote bone fragility. We used high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) to prospectively evaluate the short-term effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor luseogliflozin on bone strength and microarchitecture in elderly people with T2D. This was a single-center, randomized, open-label, active-controlled pilot trial for ≥ 60-year-old Japanese individuals with T2D without osteoporosis. A total of 22 subjects (seven women and 15 men) were randomly assigned to a Lusefi group (added luseogliflozin 2.5 mg) or a control group (added metformin 500 mg) and treated for 48 weeks. We used the second-generation HR-pQCT (Xtreme CT II®, Scanco Medical, Brüttisellen, Switzerland) before and 48 weeks after the treatment to evaluate the subjects' bone microarchitecture and estimate their bone strength. Twenty subjects (Lusefi group, n = 9; control group, n = 11) completed the study, with no fracture events. As the primary outcome, the 48-week changes in the bone strength (stiffness and failure load) estimated by micro-finite element analysis were not significantly different between the groups. As the secondary outcome, the changes in all of the cortical/trabecular microarchitectural parameters at the radius and tibia from baseline to 48 weeks were not significantly different between the groups. In the pilot trial, we observed no negative effect of 48-week luseogliflozin treatment on bone microarchitecture or bone strength in elderly people with T2D.

Whether these parameters could predict future fracture remained to be determined.The aim of this study was to compare the differences in baseline vBMD, bone microarchitecture and estimated bone strength in these patients with and without incident fragility fracture over a period of 5 years.This was a multi-centered, retrospective, case-controlled study. Patients with rheumatic diseases on long term GC from 7 regional hospitals who had dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and HR-pQCT done were invited to have a 5th year follow-up assessment. X-rays were repeated. The occurrence of new fragility fracture after 5 years was documented. The baseline clinical characteristics, aBMD, FRAX and HR-pQCT parameters in patients who experienced a new fragility fracture during the 5-year follow-up period (incident fracture group) were compared with patients who did not experience a fragility fracture (control group).A total of 140 patients were recruited. The mean age of the patients, who were mostly female (80.7%), was 58.7 ± 12.5 years at baseline. SLE and RA were the commonest diagnoses. At baseline, 45.0% and 28.6% of the patients had osteopenia or osteoporosis respectively. The baseline 10-year major osteoporotic and hip fracture risks by FRAX were 13.3% and 6.0% respectively. After 5 years, 47 (33.6%) of the patients developed new fractures. The baseline clinical characteristics of incident facture group and the control group are shown in Table 1. Patients with incident fracture were older. They also had more prevalent fracture and worse mobility. The aBMD and FRAX scores were significantly higher in the incident fracture group. When comparing the HR-pQCT parameters, the incident fracture group had significantly worse vBMD, microarchitecture and bone strength particularly over the tibia at baseline. However, the changes in these parameters were not different between the 2 groups. Multivariate regression confirmed that the baseline vBMD, microarchitectural parameters and estimated bone strength over distal tibia were independent predictors of new fractures after adjusting for age, gender as well as baseline fracture, mobility and osteoporosis status.Table 1.Demographic and clinical characteristics at baselineControl groupn=93Incident fracture groupn=47pAge (years)57 ± 1262 ± 120.015Gender, n (%)Female74 (79.6%)39 (83%)0.629Disease typeSLE40 (43.5%)21 (44.7%)0.711RA19 (20.7%)12 (25.5%)Others33 (35.9%)14 (29.8%)Mobility class, n (%)Ambulatory82 (88.2%)34 (72.3%)0.046Stick-walking9 (9.7%)12 (25.5%)Chair-bound2 (2.2%)1 (2.1%)Previous fracture, n (%)10 (10.8%)12 (25.5%)0.023MedicationsCumulative prednisolone dose (g)20.4 ± 18.722.0 ± 15.50.604Ever or current anti-osteoporotic treatment, n (%)15 (16.1%)11 (23.4%)0.310aBMD (g/cm2) atFemoral neck0.66 ± 0.120.60 ± 0.120.009Lumbar spine0.86 ± 0.150.80 ± 0.160.025FRAX score (%)Major osteoporotic fracture9.9 ± 9.420.6 ± 17.3<0.001Hip fracture3.7 ± 5.610.8 ± 13.20.001HR-pQCT parameters*Distal radius:mTb.vBMD82.0 ± 45.262.6 ± 42.40.016Distal tibia:Average vBMD258 ± 70225 ± 700.010Tb. vBMD144 ± 42122 ± 400.003pTb. vBMD221 ± 52197 ± 460.010mTb.vBMD91.3 ± 37.770.0 ± 40.00.002Tb. number1.50 ± 0.281.36 ± 0.340.010Stiffness162139 ± 42623142054 ± 353750.004Est. failure load-8173 ± 2083-7200 ± 17440.004*Only statististically significant parameters are shownA significant proportion (33.6%) of patients with rheumatic diseases on long-term GC developed new fragility fracture in 5 years, which could be predicted by the worse vBMD, microarchitecture and bone strength over tibia at baseline on HR-pQCT independent of aBMD.None declared},

 abstract = {Objective In type 1 diabetes, risk factors associated with impaired bone health contribute to increased risk of fracture. The aim of this study was to (1): compare the high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) parameters of young adults with type 1 diabetes with those of healthy controls (2), identify sex differences, and (3) evaluate the association between diabetes and bone health risk factors, with HR-pQCT. Methods This is a cross-sectional study in young Canadian adults with childhood onset type 1 diabetes. Z-scores were generated for HR-pQCT parameters using a large healthy control database. Diet, physical activity, BMI, hemoglobin A1C (A1C) and bone health measures were evaluated, and associations were analyzed using multivariate regression analysis. Results Eighty-eight participants (age 21 ± 2.2 years; 40 males, 48 females, diabetes duration 13.9 ± 3.4 years) with type 1 diabetes were studied. Low trabecular thickness and elevated cortical geometry parameters were found suggesting impaired bone quality. There were no sex differences. Significant associations were found: Vitamin D (25(OH)D) with trabecular parameters with possible synergy with A1C, parathyroid hormone with cortical parameters, BMI with cortical bone and failure load, and diabetes duration with trabecular area. Conclusions Our data suggests impairment of bone health as assessed by HR-pQCT in young adults with type 1 diabetes. Modifiable risk factors were associated with trabecular and cortical parameters. These findings imply that correction of vitamin D deficiency, prevention and treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism, and optimization of metabolic control may reduce incident fractures.},

 abstract = {Type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients have an increased fracture risk, which may be partly explained by compromised bone microarchitecture within the cortical bone compartment. Data on trabecular bone parameters in T2D are contradictory. By high‐resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR‐pQCT), trabecular microarchitecture is preserved, yet larger trabecular holes are detected in T2D by MRI and DXA‐based trabecular bone scores are abnormal. To determine if there are differences in trabecular microstructure, connectivity, and alignment in postmenopausal women with T2D as compared with controls, we performed an individual trabecula segmentation (ITS) analysis on HR‐pQCT scans of the distal radius and tibia in 92 women with (n = 42) and without (n = 50) T2D. Unadjusted analyses showed that T2D subjects had greater total trabecular bone volume, trabecular plate volume fraction, plate number density, plate junction density, and axial alignment at the radius and tibia, and increased plate tissue fraction, but decreased rod tissue fraction and rod length at the radius (p < 0.05 for all). After adjustments for clinical covariates, plate number density and plate junction density remained higher at the radius and tibia, whereas total trabecular bone volume was increased and trabecular rod length was decreased at the radius. These differences remained significant after adjustment for hip BMD and trabecular volumetric bone density. Notably, the increased plate‐like ITS qualities were seen in those with T2D duration of <10 years, whereas ITS parameters in subjects with T2D duration ≥10 years did not differ from those of control subjects. In conclusion, postmenopausal women with early T2D had a greater plate‐like and less rod‐like trabecular network. This early advantage in trabecular plate quality does not explain the well‐established increased fracture risk in these patients and does not persist in the later stage of T2D. © 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.},

 abstract = {INTRODUCTION
Obesity and type 2 Diabetes (T2D) are both associated with greater bone mineral density (BMD) but increased risk of fractures. The effect of the combination of both conditions on bone metabolism, microarchitecture and strength in the obese population remains unknown.


METHODS
Data from 112 obese men were collected. Bone turnover and biochemical markers were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), body composition and BMD at all sites were assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), whereas bone microarchitecture and strength (stiffness and failure load) were measured by high-resolution peripheral computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Data were compared among metabolically healthy obese (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUHO) with and without T2D and between obese without and with T2D.


RESULTS
Compared to MHO and MUHO without T2D, MUHO with T2D had significantly lower levels of osteocalcin ((7.49±3.0 and 6.03±2.47, vs 4.24±2.72 ng/ml, respectively, p=0.003) and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx) (0.28±0.10 and 0.29±0.13 vs. 0.21±0.15 ng/ml, respectively, p=0.02). Dividing our subjects simply into those with and without T2D showed that obese men with T2D had significantly lower levels of osteocalcin (p=0.003) and CTx (p=0.005), greater trabecular separation at the tibia and radius (p=0.03 and p=0.04, respectively) and lower tibial failure load and stiffness (both p=0.04), relative to obese men without T2D.


CONCLUSION
In men, the combination of obesity and T2D is associated with reduced bone turnover, poorer trabecular bone microarchitecture and bone strength compared to those who are obese but without T2D suggesting worse bone disease.},

 abstract = {Patients at high risk of fracture due to metabolic diseases frequently undergo long-term antiresorptive therapy. However, in some patients treatment is unsuccessful in preventing fractures or causes severe adverse health outcomes. Understanding load driven bone remodelling, i.e. mechanoregulation, is critical to understand which patients are at risk for progressive bone degeneration and may enable better patient selection or adaptive therapeutic intervention strategies. Bone microarchitecture assessment using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) combined with computed mechanical loads has successfully been used to investigate bone mechanoregulation at the trabecular level. To obtain the required mechanical loads that induce local variances in mechanical strain and cause bone remodelling, estimation of physiological loading is essential. Yet, current models homogenise strain patterns throughout the bone to estimate load distribution in vivo, which may be a flawed assumption for investigating alterations in bone mechanoregulation. By further utilising available spatiotemporal information of time-lapsed bone imaging studies, we developed a mechanoregulation-based load estimation algorithm (MR). MR calculates organ scale loads by scaling and superimposing a set of predefined independent unit loads to optimise measured bone formation in high, quiescence in medium and resorption in low strain regions. We benchmarked our algorithm against a previously published load history algorithm (LH) using synthetic data, micro-CT images of murine vertebrae under defined experimental in vivo loadings and HR-pQCT images from seven patients. Our algorithm consistently outperformed LH in all three datasets. In silico generated time evolutions of distal radius geometries (n = 5) indicated significantly higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for MR than LH (p < 0.01). This increased performance led to substantially better discrimination between physiological and extra-physiological loading in mice (n = 8). Moreover, a significantly (p < 0.01) higher association between remodelling events and computed local mechanical signals were found using MR (CCR = 0.42) than LH (CCR = 0.38) to estimate human distal radius loading. Future applications of MR may enable clinicians to link subtle changes in bone strength to changes in day-to-day loading, identifying weak spots in the bone micro-structure for local intervention and personalised treatment approaches.},

 abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is defined by elevated blood glucose levels caused by changes in glucose metabolism and, according to its pathogenesis, is classified into type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 (T2DM) diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is associated with multiple degenerative processes, including structural alterations of the bone and increased fracture risk. High-resolution peripheral computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a clinically applicable, volumetric imaging technique that unveils bone microarchitecture in vivo. Numerous studies have used HR-pQCT to assess volumetric bone mineral density and microarchitecture in patients with diabetes, including characteristics of trabecular (e.g. number, thickness and separation) and cortical bone (e.g. thickness and porosity). However, study results are heterogeneous given different imaging regions and diverse patient cohorts. This meta-analysis assessed T1DM- and T2DM-associated characteristics of bone microarchitecture measured in human populations in vivo reported in PubMed- and Embase-listed publications from inception (2005) to November 2021. The final dataset contained twelve studies with 516 participants with T2DM and 3067 controls and four studies with 227 participants with T1DM and 405 controls. While T1DM was associated with adverse trabecular characteristics, T2DM was primarily associated with adverse cortical characteristics. These adverse effects were more severe at the radius than the load-bearing tibia, indicating increased mechanical loading may compensate for deleterious bone microarchitecture changes and supporting mechanoregulation of bone fragility in diabetes mellitus. Our meta-analysis revealed distinct predilection sites of bone structure aberrations in T1DM and T2DM, which provide a foundation for the development of animal models of skeletal fragility in diabetes and may explain the uncertainty of predicting bone fragility in diabetic patients using current clinical algorithms.},

 abstract = {In their cross-sectional study, Sun et al. (Aging Clin Exp Res. 2025) provide valuable evidence that the coexistence of high body fat and low muscle mass is associated with lower bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes (T2D). While their work importantly identifies this “sarcopenic obesity” phenotype as a risk factor, our letter offers a critical appraisal to guide future research. We argue that the sole reliance on DXA-derived areal BMD is a significant limitation, as it fails to capture the deficits in bone quality (e.g., microarchitecture, material properties) that underpin the well-known paradox of increased fracture risk at normal or elevated BMD in T2D. Furthermore, the cross-sectional design and lack of biochemical data (e.g., on inflammation, adipokines, bone turnover markers) preclude any causal or mechanistic inferences about how this body composition profile affects bone.We contend that the operational definitions of sarcopenia and obesity based solely on quantity, without assessing muscle function or fat distribution, lack phenotypic precision. Moving forward, the field must adopt longitudinal designs that integrate advanced imaging (e.g., HR-pQCT) and deep metabolic phenotyping to elucidate the underlying pathways. Ultimately, this is essential for developing targeted interventions that address the intertwined pathologies of muscle, fat, and bone in this vulnerable population.},

 abstract = {Advancing age is accompanied by a reduction in bone formation and remodeling imbalance, which produces microstructural deterioration. This may be partly caused by a diversion of mesenchymal cells towards adipocytes rather than osteoblast lineage cells. We hypothesized that microstructural deterioration would be associated with an increased marrow adiposity, and each of these traits would be independently associated with nonvertebral fractures and improve discrimination of women with fractures from controls over that achieved by femoral neck (FN) areal bone mineral density (aBMD) alone. The marrow adiposity and bone microstructure were quantified from HR‐pQCT images of the distal tibia and distal radius in 77 women aged 40 to 70 years with a recent nonvertebral fracture and 226 controls in Melbourne, Australia. Marrow fat measurement from HR‐pQCT images was validated using direct histologic measurement as the gold standard, at the distal radius of 15 sheep, with an agreement (R2 = 0.86, p < 0.0001). Each SD higher distal tibia marrow adiposity was associated with 0.33 SD higher cortical porosity, and 0.60 SD fewer, 0.24 SD thinner, and 0.72 SD more‐separated trabeculae (all p < 0.05). Adjusted for age and FN aBMD, odds ratios (ORs) (95% CI) for fracture per SD higher marrow adiposity and cortical porosity were OR, 3.39 (95% CI, 2.14 to 5.38) and OR, 1.79 (95% CI, 1.14 to 2.80), respectively. Discrimination of women with fracture from controls improved when cortical porosity was added to FN aBMD and age (area under the receiver‐operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.778 versus 0.751, p = 0.006) or marrow adiposity was added to FN aBMD and age (AUC 0.825 versus 0.751, p = 0.002). The model including FN aBMD, age, cortical porosity, trabecular thickness, and marrow adiposity had an AUC = 0.888. Results were similar for the distal radius.

 abstract = {We aimed to determine whether loss of volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and deterioration of microarchitecture imaged by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography at the distal radius/tibia provided additional information in fracture discrimination in postmenopausal women with recent hip fracture. This case-control study involved 24 postmenopausal Chinese women with unilateral femoral neck fracture (average [SD] age: 79.6[5.6]) and 24 age-matched women without any history of fracture. Each SD decrease in T-score at femoral neck (FN) was associated with a higher fracture risk (odds ratio: 6.905, p = 0.001). At the distal radius, fracture women had significantly lower total vBMD (−17.5%), fewer (−20.3%) and more unevenly spaced (81.4%) trabeculae and thinner cortices (−14.0%) (all p < 0.05). At the distal tibia, vBMD was on average −4.7% (cortical) to −25.4% (total) lower, trabecular microarchitecture was on average −19.8% (number) to 102% (inhomogeneity) inferior, cortices were thinner (−21.1%) and more porous (18.2%) (all p < 0.05). Adding parameters of vBMD and microarchitecture in multivariate models did not offer additional discriminative capacity of fracture status compared with using T-score at FN. In old postmenopausal women with already excessive loss of bone mass, measuring bone microarchitecture may provide limited added value to improve identification of risk of femoral neck fracture.},

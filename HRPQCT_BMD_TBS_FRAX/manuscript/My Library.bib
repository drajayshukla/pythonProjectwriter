  abstract = {Background Older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have an increased risk of bone fracture independent of their bone mineral density (BMD), which is explained mainly by the deteriorated bone quality in T2DM compared to that in non-diabetic adults. Sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitors have been studied in several trials in T2DM, and the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study showed an increased fracture risk related to treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin, although no evidence of increased fracture risk with treatment with other SGLT2 inhibitors has been reported. The mechanism of the difference in the fracture risk between the SGLT2 inhibitors is unknown, but the differences among the SGLT2 inhibitors in the selectivity of SGLT2 against SGLT1 may affect bone metabolism, since among the SGLT2 inhibitors the selectivity of canagliflozin is lowest. We will investigate whether the SGLT2 inhibitor luseogliflozin, which has the higher SGLT2 selectivity, affects bone metabolism by using high-resolution, peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) which provides direct in vivo morphometric information about the bone microarchitecture. Methods/design This is a single-center, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, parallel pilot trial.

  abstract = {The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) is a computational tool developed to predict the 10-year probability of hip fracture and major osteoporotic fracture based on inputs of patient characteristics, bone mineral density (BMD), and a set of seven clinical risk factors. While the FRAX tool is widely available and clinically validated, its underlying algorithm is not public. The relative contribution and necessity of each input parameter to the final FRAX score is unknown. We systematically collected hip fracture risk scores from the online FRAX calculator for osteopenic Caucasian women across 473,088 unique inputs. This dataset was used to dissect the FRAX algorithm and construct a reverse-engineered fracture risk model to assess the relative contribution of each input variable. Within the reverse-engineered model, age and T-Score were the strongest contributors to hip fracture risk, while BMI had marginal contribution. Of the clinical risk factors, parent history of fracture and ongoing glucocorticoid treatment had the largest additive effect on risk score. A generalized linear model largely recapitulated the FRAX tool with an R2 of 0.91. Observed effect sizes were then compared to a true patient population by creating a logistic regression model of the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) cohort, which closely paralleled the effect sizes seen in the reverse-engineered fracture risk model. Analysis identified several clinically relevant observations of interest to FRAX users. The role of major osteoporotic fracture risk prediction in contributing to an indication of treatment need is very narrow, as the hip fracture risk prediction accounted for 98\% of treatment indications for the SOF cohort. Removing any risk factor from the model substantially decreased its accuracy and confirmed that more parsimonious models are not ideal for fracture prediction. For women 65~years and older with a previous fracture, 98\% of FRAX combinations exceeded the treatment threshold, regardless of T-score or other factors. For women age 70+ with a parent history of fracture, 99\% of FRAX combinations exceed the treatment threshold. Based on these analyses, we re-affirm the efficacy of the FRAX as the best tool for fracture risk assessment and provide deep insight into the interplay between risk factors.},

  abstract = {Hemodialysis (HD) patients face increased fracture risk, which is further associated with elevated risk of hospitalization and mortality. High-resolution peripheral computed tomography (HR-pQCT) has advanced our understanding of bone disease in chronic kidney disease by characterizing distinct changes in both the cortical and trabecular compartments. Increased cortical porosity (Ct.Po) has been shown to be associated with fracture in patients with osteopenia or in postmenopausal diabetic women. We tested whether the degree of Ct.Po identifies hemodialysis patients with prevalent fragility fractures in comparison to bone mineral density (BMD) assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). We performed a post-hoc analysis of a cross-sectional study in 76 prevalent hemodialysis patients. Markers of mineral metabolism, coronary calcification score, DXA-, and HR-pQCT-data were analyzed, and Ct.Po determined at radius and tibia. Ct.Po was significantly higher in patients with fracture but association was lost after adjusting for age and gender (tibia p = 0.228, radius p = 0.5). Instead, femoral (F) BMD neck area (p = 0.03), F T-score neck area (p = 0.03), radius (R) BMD (p = 0.03), R T-score (p = 0.03), and cortical HR-pQCT indices such as cortical area (Ct.Ar) (tibia: p = 0.01; radius: p = 0.02) and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) (tibia: p = 0.03; radius: p = 0.02) correctly classified patients with fragility fractures. Area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for Ct.Po (tibia AUC: 0.711; p = 0.01; radius AUC: 0.666; p = 0.04), Ct.Ar (tibia AUC: 0.832; p{\textexclamdown}0.001; radius AUC: 0.796; p{\textexclamdown}0.001), and F neck BMD (AUC: 0.758; p = 0.002) did not differ significantly among each other.

Implementation of the position statement in clinical practice is expected to improve the~overall care of patients with osteoporosis in India. PURPOSE: In India, osteoporosis is a major public health problem. However, in the absence of any robust regional guidelines, the screening, treatment, and follow-up of patients with osteoporosis are lagging behind in the country. METHODS: The Indian Society for~Bone and Mineral Research (ISBMR), which is a multidisciplinary group of physicians, researchers, dietitians, and epidemiologists and who study bone and related tissues, in their annual meeting, drafted the guidelines for the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis that would be appropriate in a resource constraint setting like India. RESULTS: Diagnosis of osteoporosis can be made in a patient with minimal trauma fracture without the aid of any other diagnostic tools. In others, bone mineral density measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry remains the modality of choice. Data indicates that osteoporotic fractures occur at an earlier age in Indians than in the West; hence, screening for osteoporosis should begin at an earlier age. FRAX can be used for fracture risk estimation; however, it may underestimate the risk of future fractures in our population and still needs validation. Maintaining optimum serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels is essential, which, in most cases, would require regular vitamin D supplementation. Pharmacotherapy should be guided by the presence/absence of vertebral/hip fractures or the severity of risk based on clinical factors, although bisphosphonates remain the first choice in most cases. Regular follow-up is essential to ensure adherence and response to therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the position statement in clinical practice is expected to improve the~overall care of patients with osteoporosis in India.},

  abstract = {Purpose of review This review article presents the most recent research on bone fragility in individuals with diabetes from a medical imaging perspective. Recent findings The widespread availability of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and trabecular bone score (TBS) software has led to recent assessments of bone fragility with this texture parameter in several studies of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), but in few of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). Although most studies show a trend of reduced TBS values in T2D independent of areal bone mineral density (aBMD) of the lumbar spine, some studies also show the limitations of TBS in both T2D and T1D. Given the limitations of DXA to assess bone strength and investigate the etiology of bone fragility in diabetes, more investigators are incorporating three-dimensional (3D) medical imaging techniques in their studies. Recent use of 3D medical imaging to assess bone fragility in the setting of diabetes has been mostly limited to a few cross-sectional studies predominantly incorporating high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Although HR-pQCT studies indicate higher tibial cortical porosity in subjects with T2D, results are inconsistent in T1D due to differences in study designs, sample sizes, and subject characteristics, among other factors. With respect to central CT, recent studies support a previous finding in the literature indicating femoral neck geometrical impairments in subjects with T2D and provide encouraging results for the incorporation of finite element analysis (FEA) to assess bone strength in studies of T2D. In the recent literature, there are no studies assessing bone fragility in T1D with QCT, and only two studies used pQCT reporting tibial and radial impairments in young women and children with T1D, respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has not been recently used in diabetic studies of bone fragility. Summary As bone fragility in diabetes is not explained by DXA-derived aBMD and given the limitations of cross-sectional studies, it is imperative to use 3D imaging techniques for longitudinal assessments of the density, quality, and microenvironment of bone to improve our understanding of the effects of diabetes on bone and reduce the risk of fracture in this large and vulnerable population of subjects with diabetes.}

Weight measurements taken every 4 to 6 years were used to assess recent weight change over 6 years and long-term change over 40 years. General linear models, adjusting for age, sex, height, smoking, and diabetes, were used to evaluate the association between HR-pQCT indices and relative long-term and recent weight change. We found that long-term and recent weight loss were associated with lower cortical density and thickness, higher cortical porosity, and lower trabecular density and number. Associations were stronger for the tibia than radius. Failure load was lower in those individuals with long-term but not short-term weight loss. Deterioration in both cortical and trabecular indices, especially at the weight-bearing skeleton, characterizes bone fragility associated with long-term and recent weight loss in older adults. {\copyright} 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.}

  abstract = {Diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is associated with increased fracture risk that cannot be fully explained by traditional bone mineral density (BMD) measurements. Emerging evidence suggests that diabetes-induced alterations in bone microarchitecture, remodeling, and mechanoregulation contribute to skeletal fragility. However, the specific structural and functional changes in bone differ between T1DM and T2DM, and the mechanisms underlying these differences remain incompletely understood.Innovation in medical imaging and increasingly accessible computational power have made it possible to monitor changes in bone microarchitecture and measure the mechanical properties of bone via image-based finite element analysis. Moreover, longitudinal clinical studies have also shown that the combined use of high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) and micro-finite element analysis can be used to measure load-driven bone remodelling in vivo.This talk will present findings from a meta-analysis of high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) studies assessing diabetes-related differences in bone structure and a longitudinal cohort study, conducted with partners from the FIDELIO -- Bone Health in Diabetes Innovative Training Network, examining bone remodeling and mechanoregulation in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).The meta-analysis synthesized data from 16 studies, encompassing 743 individuals with diabetes and 3,472 controls, to characterize the impact of T1DM and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on bone microarchitecture. Results revealed that T1DM is predominantly associated with adverse trabecular characteristics, whereas T2DM is linked to cortical deficits, with more pronounced deterioration at the radius than at the weight-bearing tibia. These findings suggest that mechanical loading may mitigate some diabetes-associated skeletal changes, emphasizing the role of mechanoregulation in bone fragility.Complementing these insights, a four-year longitudinal cohort study investigated bone remodeling dynamics and responsiveness to mechanical stimuli in individuals with T1DM and diabetic neuropathy. By integrating HR-pQCT imaging with micro-finite element analysis, the study found that T1DM is characterized by lower trabecular bone formation (47}

  abstract = {In their cross-sectional study, Sun et al. (Aging Clin Exp Res. 2025) provide valuable evidence that the coexistence of high body fat and low muscle mass is associated with lower bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes (T2D). While their work importantly identifies this ``sarcopenic obesity'' phenotype as a risk factor, our letter offers a critical appraisal to guide future research. We argue that the sole reliance on DXA-derived areal BMD is a significant limitation, as it fails to capture the deficits in bone quality (e.g., microarchitecture, material properties) that underpin the well-known paradox of increased fracture risk at normal or elevated BMD in T2D. Furthermore, the cross-sectional design and lack of biochemical data (e.g., on inflammation, adipokines, bone turnover markers) preclude any causal or mechanistic inferences about how this body composition profile affects bone.We contend that the operational definitions of sarcopenia and obesity based solely on quantity, without assessing muscle function or fat distribution, lack phenotypic precision. Moving forward, the field must adopt longitudinal designs that integrate advanced imaging (e.g., HR-pQCT) and deep metabolic phenotyping to elucidate the underlying pathways. Ultimately, this is essential for developing targeted interventions that address the intertwined pathologies of muscle, fat, and bone in this vulnerable population.}

  year = {2021},
  abstract = {In their comment to my recent Editorial entitled `Osteosarcopenia: A Geriatric Giant of the XXI Century'' (1), the authors narrowed their observations to the epidemiological aspects of this recently described geriatric syndrome. An important consideration the authors failed to mention is that all four prospective cohort studies and the cross-sectional study cited in their comment used DXA-derived lean mass measurements in the definitions of osteosarcopenia/ sarcopenia. Despite our recommendation to use DXA-lean mass in the osteosarcopenia definitions due to its wide use in clinical settings (2), we are aware that DXA-lean mass is a surrogate measure of muscle mass and not an accurate measure when compared to other imaging modalities (MRI/pQCT/ HR-pQCT) (3). Indeed, recent work from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (n = 1,425, age 77-101 years) showed that while accurate measures of muscle mass (measured by creatine dilution) are strongly associated with incident mobility disability, falls and mortality, DXA-appendicular lean mass (including adjustments for height squared and BMI) are not (4, 5). Thus, the prospective cohort studies cited in the comment have not tested the interactions using accurate measures of muscle mass with bone density/structure. Given the wellknown mechanical and metabolic relationship between muscle and bone, there is a strong biological rationale to test this hypothesis through a robust longitudinal study design, as we have previously suggested (1, 2). Still, based on currently available evidence, multiple groups worldwide (including ours) are investigating whether osteosarcopenia implies a greater risk of fractures, mortality, and falls (6), a question that deserves further exploration and that highlights the importance of identifying these two conditions in clinical practice, while understanding the limitations of current studies and looking forward to the results of several ongoing longitudinal cohorts in the field, which are using more accurate and sensitive structural and clinical methods to identify osteopenia/osteoporosis and sarcopenia in older persons. A particularly concerning element of this comment is the authors' indistinguishable use of the terms ``disease'' and ``geriatric syndrome''. The concept of geriatric syndromes, which is universally taught during early training years in geriatric medicine, is defined as ``highly prevalent in older persons, multifactorial, and associated with substantial morbidity and poor outcomes'' (7), which is clearly the case of osteosarcopenia, a syndrome whose recognition has been affected by research and clinical silos and fragmented models of care. The intention of the Editorial was not to ``create a new disease'' as stated by the authors, which is unnecessary considering that both osteoporosis and sarcopenia are wellrecognised diseases, but to increase awareness of the existence of a geriatric syndrome (Geriatric Giant) that ``could become the unifier concept that will finally improve care to these devastating conditions''.}

Data of patients with IBD and non-IBD matched controls (approximately 3 non-IBD controls per case) were retrieved from the epi-IIRN cohort (January 2005- June 2020) that maintain data on all patients with IBD from the four Israeli HMOs. Data included demographics, osteoporosis medications, fracture data and IBD related characteristics. Patients were stratified by age group (0-17,18-49, and {$\geq$}50). Patients with known osteopenia or osteoporosis before IBD diagnosis were excluded. We included 32,263 patients with IBD and 89,423 non-IBD controls [48 In this large nationwide cohort, patients with IBD had significantly higher risk for bone fractures than matched controls in almost all age groups, with no difference between CD and UC. Additionally, the rate of osteopenia and osteoporosis was higher in patients with IBD, suggesting that further efforts need to be invested in bone health of this at-risk population.}

The aim of this study was to (1): compare the high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) parameters of young adults with type 1 diabetes with those of healthy controls (2), identify sex differences, and (3) evaluate the association between diabetes and bone health risk factors, with HR-pQCT. Methods This is a cross-sectional study in young Canadian adults with childhood onset type 1 diabetes. Z-scores were generated for HR-pQCT parameters using a large healthy control database. Diet, physical activity, BMI, hemoglobin A1C (A1C) and bone health measures were evaluated, and associations were analyzed using multivariate regression analysis. Results Eighty-eight participants (age 21 {\textpm} 2.2 years; 40 males, 48 females, diabetes duration 13.9 {\textpm} 3.4 years) with type 1 diabetes were studied. Low trabecular thickness and elevated cortical geometry parameters were found suggesting impaired bone quality. There were no sex differences. Significant associations were found: Vitamin D (25(OH)D) with trabecular parameters with possible synergy with A1C, parathyroid hormone with cortical parameters, BMI with cortical bone and failure load, and diabetes duration with trabecular area. Conclusions Our data suggests impairment of bone health as assessed by HR-pQCT in young adults with type 1 diabetes. Modifiable risk factors were associated with trabecular and cortical parameters. These findings imply that correction of vitamin D deficiency, prevention and treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism, and optimization of metabolic control may reduce incident fractures.}

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION Obesity and type 2 Diabetes (T2D) are both associated with greater bone mineral density (BMD) but increased risk of fractures. The effect of the combination of both conditions on bone metabolism, microarchitecture and strength in the obese population remains unknown. METHODS Data from 112 obese men were collected. Bone turnover and biochemical markers were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), body composition and BMD at all sites were assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), whereas bone microarchitecture and strength (stiffness and failure load) were measured by high-resolution peripheral computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Data were compared among metabolically healthy obese (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUHO) with and without T2D and between obese without and with T2D. RESULTS Compared to MHO and MUHO without T2D, MUHO with T2D had significantly lower levels of osteocalcin ((7.49{\textpm}3.0 and 6.03{\textpm}2.47, vs 4.24{\textpm}2.72 ng/ml, respectively, p=0.003) and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx) (0.28{\textpm}0.10 and 0.29{\textpm}0.13 vs. 0.21{\textpm}0.15 ng/ml, respectively, p=0.02). Dividing our subjects simply into those with and without T2D showed that obese men with T2D had significantly lower levels of osteocalcin (p=0.003) and CTx (p=0.005), greater trabecular separation at the tibia and radius (p=0.03 and p=0.04, respectively) and lower tibial failure load and stiffness (both p=0.04), relative to obese men without T2D. CONCLUSION In men, the combination of obesity and T2D is associated with reduced bone turnover, poorer trabecular bone microarchitecture and bone strength compared to those who are obese but without T2D suggesting worse bone disease.}

  abstract = {Type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients have an increased fracture risk, which may be partly explained by compromised bone microarchitecture within the cortical bone compartment. Data on trabecular bone parameters in T2D are contradictory. By high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT), trabecular microarchitecture is preserved, yet larger trabecular holes are detected in T2D by MRI and DXA-based trabecular bone scores are abnormal. To determine if there are differences in trabecular microstructure, connectivity, and alignment in postmenopausal women with T2D as compared with controls, we performed an individual trabecula segmentation (ITS) analysis on HR-pQCT scans of the distal radius and tibia in 92 women with (n\,=\,42) and without (n\,=\,50) T2D. Unadjusted analyses showed that T2D subjects had greater total trabecular bone volume, trabecular plate volume fraction, plate number density, plate junction density, and axial alignment at the radius and tibia, and increased plate tissue fraction, but decreased rod tissue fraction and rod length at the radius (p\,{\textexclamdown}\,0.05 for all). After adjustments for clinical covariates, plate number density and plate junction density remained higher at the radius and tibia, whereas total trabecular bone volume was increased and trabecular rod length was decreased at the radius. These differences remained significant after adjustment for hip BMD and trabecular volumetric bone density. Notably, the increased plate-like ITS qualities were seen in those with T2D duration of {\textexclamdown}10 years, whereas ITS parameters in subjects with T2D duration {$\geq$}10 years did not differ from those of control subjects. In conclusion, postmenopausal women with early T2D had a greater plate-like and less rod-like trabecular network. This early advantage in trabecular plate quality does not explain the well-established increased fracture risk in these patients and does not persist in the later stage of T2D. {\copyright} 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.}

  abstract = {Chronic kidney disease (CKD) often leads to mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD), which compromise bone quality and increase fracture risk. These bone complications frequently persist after kidney transplantation (K-Tx), primarily due to the lingering effects of pre-existing CKD-MBD. Our aim was to evaluate CKD-MBD biomarkers, bone turnover markers, vitamin K-dependent protein (VKDP) levels, and bone microarchitecture using HR-pQCT at the time of K-Tx (T0) and 12 months post-transplant (T2). The main objective was to establish the association between VKDPs and HR-pQCT-derived bone quality parameters. We analyzed data from a cohort of 61 K-Tx patients: mean age 50.9 {\textpm} 13.3 years, 67 Significant improvements were observed in all CKD-MBD biomarkers and bone turnover markers 12 months post-transplant, except for Bone ALP and Klotho levels. PTH decreased from 100 to 27 ng/L, and CTX from 1524 to 246 pg/ml (Fig. 1). VKDP levels also showed significant improvement. The prevalence of vitamin K deficiency, based on a cut-off level of uc-BGP {$\geq$}4.5 ng/ml, decreased from 77 Our data confirm an improvement in vitamin K status one year after K-Tx. Additionally, the inverse correlation between ucBGP and bone quality parameters assessed by HR-pQCT underscores the crucial role of BGP in bone health. To our knowledge, these are the first reported data in the literature.}

  abstract = {CONTEXT Impaired bone microarchitecture, assessed by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT), may contribute to bone fragility in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) but data on men are lacking. OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between T2DM and HR-pQCT parameters in older men. METHODS HR-pQCT scans were acquired on 1794 participants in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study. T2DM was ascertained by self-report or medication use. Linear regression models, adjusted for age, race, BMI, limb length, clinic site, and oral corticosteroid use, were used to compare HR-pQCT parameters by diabetes status. RESULTS Among 1777 men, 290 had T2DM (mean age 84.4 years). T2DM men had smaller total cross-sectional area (Tt.AR) at the distal tibia (p=0.028) and diaphyseal tibia (p=0.025), and smaller cortical area at the distal (p= 0.009) and diaphyseal tibia (p= 0.023). Trabecular indices and cortical porosity were similar between T2DM and non-T2DM. Among men with T2DM, in a model including HbA1c, diabetes duration, and insulin use, diabetes duration {$\geq$} 10 years, compared with {\textexclamdown}10 years, was significantly associated with higher cortical porosity but with higher trabecular thickness at the distal radius. Insulin use was significantly associated with lower cortical area and thickness at the distal radius and diaphyseal tibia and lower failure load at all three scan sites. Lower cortical area, cortical thickness, total BMD, cortical BMD, and failure load of the distal sites were associated with increased risk of incident non-vertebral fracture in T2DM. CONCLUSIONS Older men with T2DM have smaller bone size compared to non-T2DM, which may contribute to diabetic skeletal fragility. Longer diabetes duration was associated with higher cortical porosity and insulin use with cortical bone deficits and lower failure load.}

  abstract = {Abstract Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) increases the risk of fracture at any given bone mineral density (BMD). However, the optimal strategy for osteoporosis screening with DXA is unknown in those with DM. A previously described strategy in the general population known as ``Opportunistic Osteoporosis Screening'' uses computer tomography (CT) images done for other reasons to assess the attenuation (density) of L1 in Hounsfield units (HU)---this was found to correlate with DXA-derived T-score. However, neither the methodology nor the cut-points have been specifically validated in those with DM. Thus, the goal of this study was to examine the performance of this methodology and define thresholds corresponding with low BMD in those with DM. Methods: This was retrospective study using electronic medical record data. Patients with DM were identified by ICD code. Those with both abdominal CT and DXA within a 6-month period were included, excluding patients with CKD stage 5, solid organ transplantation, bariatric surgery, or L1 hardware. L1 attenuation, measured by 2 readers on sagittal view, were averaged. A different reader assessed for vertebral fractures. Fractures of the hip, forearm, humerus, and pelvis were identified by ICD code. The lowest T-score of lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip, or forearm (available in 11 subjects) was used to compare to L1 attenuation. ROC curves were derived from univariate logistic regression. Results: 320 subjects met study criteria; 10 (3.2}

  year = {2021},
  abstract = {Patients at high risk of fracture due to metabolic diseases frequently undergo long-term antiresorptive therapy. However, in some patients treatment is unsuccessful in preventing fractures or causes severe adverse health outcomes. Understanding load driven bone remodelling, i.e. mechanoregulation, is critical to understand which patients are at risk for progressive bone degeneration and may enable better patient selection or adaptive therapeutic intervention strategies. Bone microarchitecture assessment using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) combined with computed mechanical loads has successfully been used to investigate bone mechanoregulation at the trabecular level. To obtain the required mechanical loads that induce local variances in mechanical strain and cause bone remodelling, estimation of physiological loading is essential. Yet, current models homogenise strain patterns throughout the bone to estimate load distribution in vivo, which may be a flawed assumption for investigating alterations in bone mechanoregulation. By further utilising available spatiotemporal information of time-lapsed bone imaging studies, we developed a mechanoregulation-based load estimation algorithm (MR). MR calculates organ scale loads by scaling and superimposing a set of predefined independent unit loads to optimise measured bone formation in high, quiescence in medium and resorption in low strain regions. We benchmarked our algorithm against a previously published load history algorithm (LH) using synthetic data, micro-CT images of murine vertebrae under defined experimental in vivo loadings and HR-pQCT images from seven patients. Our algorithm consistently outperformed LH in all three datasets. In silico generated time evolutions of distal radius geometries (n = 5) indicated significantly higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for MR than LH (p {\textexclamdown} 0.01). This increased performance led to substantially better discrimination between physiological and extra-physiological loading in mice (n = 8). Moreover, a significantly (p {\textexclamdown} 0.01) higher association between remodelling events and computed local mechanical signals were found using MR (CCR = 0.42) than LH (CCR = 0.38) to estimate human distal radius loading. Future applications of MR may enable clinicians to link subtle changes in bone strength to changes in day-to-day loading, identifying weak spots in the bone micro-structure for local intervention and personalised treatment approaches.}

  abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is defined by elevated blood glucose levels caused by changes in glucose metabolism and, according to its pathogenesis, is classified into type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 (T2DM) diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is associated with multiple degenerative processes, including structural alterations of the bone and increased fracture risk. High-resolution peripheral computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a clinically applicable, volumetric imaging technique that unveils bone microarchitecture in vivo. Numerous studies have used HR-pQCT to assess volumetric bone mineral density and microarchitecture in patients with diabetes, including characteristics of trabecular (e.g. number, thickness and separation) and cortical bone (e.g. thickness and porosity). However, study results are heterogeneous given different imaging regions and diverse patient cohorts. This meta-analysis assessed T1DM- and T2DM-associated characteristics of bone microarchitecture measured in human populations in vivo reported in PubMed- and Embase-listed publications from inception (2005) to November 2021. The final dataset contained twelve studies with 516 participants with T2DM and 3067 controls and four studies with 227 participants with T1DM and 405 controls. While T1DM was associated with adverse trabecular characteristics, T2DM was primarily associated with adverse cortical characteristics. These adverse effects were more severe at the radius than the load-bearing tibia, indicating increased mechanical loading may compensate for deleterious bone microarchitecture changes and supporting mechanoregulation of bone fragility in diabetes mellitus. Our meta-analysis revealed distinct predilection sites of bone structure aberrations in T1DM and T2DM, which provide a foundation for the development of animal models of skeletal fragility in diabetes and may explain the uncertainty of predicting bone fragility in diabetic patients using current clinical algorithms.}

  abstract = {Summary Volumetric bone density (vBMD) and trabecular microarchitecture measured by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) can discriminate the patients with high risk of asymptomatic vertebral fracture (VF) in postmenopausal Chinese women. These findings suggested that HR-pQCT could provide additional information on bone quality of the patients with asymptomatic VF. Introduction Although there were several studies using HR-pQCT to investigate asymptomatic VF, it remains uncertain if HR-pQCT parameters can discriminate asymptomatic VF patients, especially in Chinese population. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether bone quality measured by HR-pQCT could discriminate asymptomatic VF independent of hip areal bone mineral density (aBMD) measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and fracture risks evaluated using built-in Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX BMD ). Methods This is a nested case--control study. One hundred seventy-five ambulatory Chinese postmenopausal women aged 60--79 years were retrieved from Normative Reference Standards (NRS) cohort in Hong Kong. DXA was used to identify VF from lateral spine images (VFA) using Genant's semi-quantitative method. Major osteoporotic fracture risk was calculated using FRAX tool. HR-pQCT was used to assess vBMD, microarchitecture, and estimated strength at both distal radius and tibia. Comparison of HR-pQCT parameters between asymptomatic VF and control was performed using covariance analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed for calculating the adjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95}

We investigated bone microarchitecture and its associated factors in Japanese with T1D using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Methods: We recruited individuals with T1D aged {$\geq$}20 years, who had not been treated with anti-osteoporosis drugs. Microstructures in distal radius and tibia were evaluated by HR-pQCT (Xtreme CT II{\textregistered}) in subjects with T1D and those without diabetes, matching 1:1 for age, sex, height, and BMI. Results: 58 adults with T1D (age 52{\textpm}13 ys, duration 14{\textpm}12 ys) were enrolled. In trabecular (Tb) bone in tibia, compared to non-diabetes, T1D subjects showed significant decreases in volumetric BMD (vBMD) and Tb number (Tb.N), and a significant increase in Tb separation (Tb.Sp). No significant differences were observed in cortical (Ct) values of tibia between T1D and non-diabetes. All Tb/Ct values of radius showed a similar tendency to those of tibia, but without significant differences between T1D and non-diabetes. Age was negatively correlated with Tb.vBMD and Tb.N, and positively correlated with Tb.Sp. Total insulin dose was negatively and positively correlated with Tb.N and Tb.Sp, respectively. Deterioration of Ct bone in vBMD, thickness, and porosity was observed in subjects complicated with neuropathy. In sub-analysis of males, in addition to Tb finding observed in all subjects, Ct vBMD and Ct thickness were significantly decreased in T1D than non-diabetes. Complications of neuropathy or retinopathy showed significant effects on Tb and Ct deterioration in males but not females. Conclusion: T1D is associated with microarchitectural deterioration in Tb rather than Ct bone, with a stronger impact in males. Microvascular complications may accelerate the risk especially in males. M. Kubo: None. E. Nakaji: None. I. Horie: None. K. Chiba: None. M. Osaki: None. A. Kawakami: None.}

Godoy-Matos: None. M. Madeira: None. Introduction: Familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL) is a rare condition with genetic diversity, characterized by the deficiency of adipose tissue in the lower limbs and gluteus, insulin resistance and metabolic alterations. Although the relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and fracture risk is well established, there is a scarcity of data on the association between fracture risk and FPL.Objective: To assess the risk of fractures in patients with FPL by bone mineral density and microarchitecture, as well as possible factors involved in this association. Methods: Cross-sectional study that selected patients from an outpatient clinic for FPL and controls from a database of healthy individuals. Clinical evaluation and examinations were made by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and high-resolution quantitative peripheral computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Results: 24 patients were included in the FPL group, while 20 controls. FPL group with a mean age of 43.4 years ({\textpm} 11.9) and median body mass index (BMI) of 25.3 (22.5 - 39.2) kg/m{$^2$}. In the control group, the mean age was 39.4 ({\textpm} 6.4) and median BMI of 25.6 (22 - 37.6) kg/m{$^2$}. There was no significant difference between groups with respect to age (p 0.185) and BMI (p 0.506). In the FPL group, 15 participants had a diagnosis of DM, with a mean disease duration of 16.5 years ({\textpm} 7.4). Molecular analysis in FPL group did not identify mutations in two patients, while 10 presented LMNA variant, 4 patients LPL (heterozygous), 3 with PPARG, 2 presented AKT in association with LMNA variant. Rare variants in one patient each as BSCL2 (heterozygous), MFN2 and SPINK1. Regarding DEXA, there was a statistical difference in the Z-score of the spine and femur, with higher values in the FPL group. Evaluating HR-pQCT in the tibia and radius, there was no statistical difference in the comparison between the two groups. A comparison between the FPL subgroup with DM and the controls showed a statistical difference in the radius trabecular thickness parameter (Tb.Th), with greater Tb.Th in the FPL group with DM (median 0.078 mm versus 0.065 mm - p 0.048). This subgroup has a median of the highest triglyceride level of 1234 mg/dl, while the median of subgroup without DM is 371 mg/dl (p 0.028). Two patients presented femur fracture after falling from their own height during the study - after 20 years of diagnosis of DM and additional risk factors for frailty. Conclusion: Although the data does not indicate a higher risk of fractures in patients with FPL compared to controls and a greater Tb.Th was identified in the HR-pQCT evaluation in the subgroup of 15 patients with DM in relation to the control, two patients with DM presented osteoporotic fractures. The results suggest that hyperinsulinemia may have an anabolic effect on the bone, but with an evolution of greater bone fragility as the disease progresses to DM with complications and other associated risk factors for fracture.

In the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study, the subjects with T2D who were treated with canagliflozin showed a significant increase in fracture events compared to a placebo group as early as 12 weeks post-initiation. In addition, it has been unclear whether sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors promote bone fragility. We used high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) to prospectively evaluate the short-term effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor luseogliflozin on bone strength and microarchitecture in elderly people with T2D. This was a single-center, randomized, open-label, active-controlled pilot trial for\,{$\geq$}\,60-year-old Japanese individuals with T2D without osteoporosis. A total of 22 subjects (seven women and 15 men) were randomly assigned to a Lusefi group (added luseogliflozin 2.5 mg) or a control group (added metformin 500 mg) and treated for 48 weeks. We used the second-generation HR-pQCT (Xtreme CT II{\textregistered}, Scanco Medical, Br{\"u}ttisellen, Switzerland) before and 48 weeks after the treatment to evaluate the subjects' bone microarchitecture and estimate their bone strength. Twenty subjects (Lusefi group, n\,=\,9; control group, n\,=\,11) completed the study, with no fracture events. As the primary outcome, the 48-week changes in the bone strength (stiffness and failure load) estimated by micro-finite element analysis were not significantly different between the groups. As the secondary outcome, the changes in all of the cortical/trabecular microarchitectural parameters at the radius and tibia from baseline to 48 weeks were not significantly different between the groups. In the pilot trial, we observed no negative effect of 48-week luseogliflozin treatment on bone microarchitecture or bone strength in elderly people with T2D.

  abstract = {Introduction Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and osteoporotic fracture are commoner in older patients (pts). Steroids and chemotherapy are recognised as a risk factor (RF) for fragility-related fracture and its associated morbidity. A small randomised trial (RCT) (Westin 2013) showed bisphosphonates stabilize bone mineral density (including all ages / histologies) in NHL pts. Despite this, there is a lack of data defining the specific incidence and fracture risk in older DLBCL pts post R-CHOP. We aimed to better define this risk in this specific cohort. Methods Data on consecutive DLBCL pts {$\geq$}70 years (y) treated with R-CHOP were retrospectively collected across 7 UK centres (2009-2019). Follow up was censored in 07/2019. All pts had untreated, de novo DLBCL or untreated transformed (to DLBCL) indolent B cell NHL. PTLD, HIV and pre-treated NHL pts were excluded. All pts received 1-9 cycles of full or attenuated R-CHOP with curative intent. Pts were excluded if they had progressive disease (PD) or died {\textexclamdown} 6 months (m) of cycle 1 R-CHOP (RCHOP1). A detailed anonymised database included ECOG performance status (PS), body mass index (BMI), history of osteoporosis / osteopenia, documented steroid pre-phase, vitamin D supplementation, calcium and alkaline phosphatase levels, and sites of bone DLBCL involvement. Fractures at diagnosis (DLBCL-related/unrelated) and pre diagnosis were collected. Fractures (including bone site) occurring during 18m from RCHOP1 were identified from radiology records. Pts were followed for a minimum of 6m and censored at 18m from RCHOP1, or at their last follow up if {\textexclamdown} 18m or at PD or death if between 6-18m. Baseline pt characteristics were descriptive. Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan Meier methods and Cox regression with comparisons between categories using the log-rank test. Time to event analyses were measured from RCHOP1 until fracture event. Primary end point was 18m cumulative fracture incidence censoring pts at death or relapse. Univariable and multivariable analyses (UVA; MVA) of potential influencing RFs for fracture was assessed by Cox regression (Final stepwise model; p=0.1 for inclusion). Results Of 589 pts identified, 92 pts had PD or died prior to 6m and were excluded. 20 pts were excluded due to short follow up. Across 477 pts, the median age was 77 (range 70-93) y. 66The median BMI was 25.5 (range 14.2-48.1). 8.1Overall, there were 52 fractures, including 50 within 18m follow up. Cumulative fracture incidence was 6.36 pts had multiple fracture sites (2; n=5, 3; n=1). 32 (62Univariable RFs included female sex (hazard ratio (HR) 1.89 (95Conclusions This is the largest series to date to show there is a clinically relevant fracture risk in older DLBCL pts specifically receiving R-CHOP in early follow up. Our data have limitations inherent to a retrospective study including the potential for unknown confounders, missing data, and medical record misinterpretation. Prospective data is required to validate RFs identified which could enable targeting a high-risk population. An RCT is needed to determine the value of prophylactic intervention(s) in high risk pts.

  abstract = {Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a rare phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous group of inherited skeletal dysplasias. The hallmark features of OI include bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures, bone deformity, and diminished growth, along with a plethora of associated secondary features (both skeletal and extraskeletal). The diagnosis of OI is currently made on clinical grounds and may be confirmed by genetic testing. However, imaging remains pivotal in the evaluation of this disease. The aim of this article is to review the current role played by the various radiologic techniques in the diagnosis and monitoring of OI in the postnatal setting as well as to discuss recent advances and future perspectives in OI imaging. Conventional Radiography and Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) are currently the two most used imaging modalities in OI. The cardinal radiographic features of OI include generalized osteopenia/osteoporosis, bone deformities, and fractures. DXA is currently the most available technique to assess Bone Mineral Density (BMD), specifically areal BMD (aBMD). However, DXA has important limitations and cannot fully characterize bone fragility in OI based on aBMD. Novel DXA-derived parameters, such as Trabecular Bone Score (TBS), may provide further insight into skeletal changes induced by OI, but evidence is still limited. Techniques like Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can be useful as problem-solvers or in specific settings, including the evaluation of cranio-cervical abnormalities. Recent evidence supports the use of High-Resolution peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR-pQCT) as a promising tool to improve the characterization of bone fragility in OI. However, HR-pQCT remains a primarily research technique at present. Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) is an alternative to DXA for the determination of BMD at central sites, with distinct advantages but considerably higher radiation exposure. Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) is a portable, inexpensive, and radiation-free modality that may complement DXA evaluation, providing information on bone quality. However, evidence of usefulness of QUS in OI is poor. Radiofrequency Echographic Multi Spectrometry (REMS) is an emerging non-ionizing imaging method that holds promise for the diagnosis of low BMD and for the prediction of fracture risk, but so far only one published study has investigated its role in OI. To conclude, several different radiologic techniques have proven to be effective in the diagnosis and monitoring of OI, each with their own specificities and peculiarities. Clinicians should be aware of the strategic role of the various modalities in the different phases of the patient care process. In this scenario, the development of international guidelines including recommendations on the role of imaging in the diagnosis and monitoring of OI, accompanied by continuous active research in the field, could significantly improve the standardization of patient care.}

  abstract = {Background: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is characterized by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic {$\beta$}- cells with consequent absolute insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia. Adult patients with T1D have a sixfold increased fracture risk. However, this increase in fracture risk in T1D patients could not be explained by BMD alone. As far as skeletal microarchitecture in T1D is concerned, data is sparse in world literature and absent in Indian population. Hence, we aimed to study the skeletal microarchitecture in T1D subjects as assessed by High Resolution Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR-pQCT) and compared these parameters with age, sex and BMI matched controls. Methods: We recruited 31 T1D cases without celiac disease (Group A: Male15, Female 16), 11 T1D cases with celiac disease (Group B: Male 5, Female 6) and 19 age, sex and BMI matched healthy control (Group C: Male 10, Female 9). Blood biochemistry and hormonal profile including calcium profile, 25(OH) vitamin D, iPTH and HbA1C level between the Group A and B were compared. The HR-pQCT parameters among the three groups were also compared. Results: The median age of male and female participants in Group A [22 (20-25) years and 23 (22-26) years], Group B [26 (22-31) and 23 (21-24) years] and Group C [27 (18-28) years and 26 (25-27) years] were comparable. BMI was also comparable between the three groups. The duration of diabetes, insulin dose per kg body weight, calcium profile, 25(OH) vitamin DandiPTH level were similar between Group A and B. Median HbA1C value in male and female subjects within Group A and B were 7.05 (6.4-8.0)}

  author = {T. Prasad, Rimesh Kumar Bhadada},

  abstract = {Background: There is an increased risk of fragility fractures in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Bone mineral density (BMD) as measured by DEXAmay be increased despite poor quality of bone and thus FRAX may underestimate the risk of fractures in this population. HR-pQCT is a non-invasive imaging modality for assessment of volumetric BMD (vBMD) and microarchitecture of cancellous and cortical bones. Also the available data regarding the choice of anti-osteoporotic therapy in T2DM are based on either preclinical studies or posthoc/subgroup analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with no head-to-head comparison. We aim to compare the efficacy of the three most commonly used anti-osteoporotic medications, namely, teriparatide, zoledronate and denosumab, in a cohort of postmenopausal women with T2DM at a high risk of incident fragility fractures. Methods: Here we present the interim analysis after 6 months of an open-labelled randomised control trial of 120 postmenopausal women with T2DM enrolled for 18 months follow-up. Patients were randomised into 4 groups in 1:1:1:1 ratio, with group Areceiving teriparatide, group B receiving zoledronate, Group C receiving denosumab each along with calcium and vitamin D supplements and group D receiving only calcium and vitamin D supplements. The objective was to determine the effects of the anti-osteoporotic drugs on HR-pQCT parameters at the end of 6 months compared to at the time of enrolment. Results: 31 patients who completed their 6 months follow-up were included in the analysis, 8 in group A, 7 in group B and D and 9 in group C. There were no significant change in the vBMD amongst the groups at 6 months at both tibia (p = 0.075) and radius (p = 0.067). There was a decrease in the total vBMD in all the 4 groups at tibia. However at the radius, total vBMD increased in group B and decreased in the rest, however the intra-group changes were not significant. There was a statistically significant difference in trabecular spacing at tibia between group A (increased) and group C (decreased) (p = 0.031). There were no significant changes in other bone microarchitecture parameters. Conclusion: At the end of 6 months, there were no significant changes in volumetric BMD and bone microarchitecture at both tibia and radius amongst the groups except for trabecular spacing. Larger number of patients with longer follow-up would help in further understanding.}
